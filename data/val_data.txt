<question>what is (are) breast cancer ?<answer>there are two types of breast-conserving surgery -- lumpectomy and partial mastectomy. - lumpectomy is the removal of the tumor and a small amount of normal tissue around it. a woman who has a lumpectomy almost always has radiation therapy as well. most surgeons also take out some of the lymph nodes under the arm. lumpectomy is the removal of the tumor and a small amount of normal tissue around it. a woman who has a lumpectomy almost always has radiation therapy as well. most surgeons also take out some of the lymph nodes under the arm. - partial or segmental mastectomy is removal of the cancer, some of the breast tissue around the tumor, and the lining over the chest muscles below the tumor. often, surgeons remove some of the lymph nodes under the arm. in most cases, radiation therapy follows. partial or segmental mastectomy is removal of the cancer, some of the breast tissue around the tumor, and the lining over the chest muscles below the tumor. often, surgeons remove some of the lymph nodes under the arm. in most cases, radiation therapy follows.<end>
<question>how to prevent prostate cancer ?<answer>key points - avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer. - the following risk factors may increase the risk of prostate cancer: - age - family history of prostate cancer - race - hormones - vitamin e - folic acid - dairy and calcium - the following protective factors may decrease the risk of prostate cancer: - folate - finasteride and dutasteride - the following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known: - selenium and vitamin e - diet - multivitamins - lycopene - cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. - new ways to prevent prostate cancer are being studied in clinical trials. avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer. avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer. the following risk factors may increase the risk of prostate cancer: age prostate cancer is rare in men younger than 50 years of age. the chance of developing prostate cancer increases as men get older. family history of prostate cancer a man whose father, brother, or son has had prostate cancer has a higher-than-average risk of prostate cancer. race prostate cancer occurs more often in african-american men than in white men. african-american men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than white men with prostate cancer. hormones the prostate needs male hormones to work the way it should. the main male sex hormone is testosterone. testosterone helps the body develop and maintain male sex characteristics. testosterone is changed into dihydrotestosterone (dht) by an enzyme in the body. dht is important for normal prostate growth but can also cause the prostate to get bigger and may play a part in the development of prostate cancer. vitamin e the selenium and vitamin e cancer prevention trial (select) found that vitamin e taken alone increased the risk of prostate cancer. the risk continued even after the men stopped taking vitamin e. folic acid folate is a kind of vitamin b that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice. folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. a 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid. however, the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets. dairy and calcium a diet high in dairy foods and calcium may cause a small increase in the risk of prostate cancer. the following protective factors may decrease the risk of prostate cancer: folate folate is a kind of vitamin b that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice. folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. a 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets. however, the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid. finasteride and dutasteride finasteride and dutasteride are drugs used to lower the amount of male sex hormones made by the body. these drugs block the enzyme that changes testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (dht). higher than normal levels of dht may play a part in developing prostate cancer. taking finasteride or dutasteride has been shown to lower the risk for prostate cancer, but it is not known if these drugs lower the risk of death from prostate cancer. the prostate cancer prevention trial (pcpt) studied whether the drug finasteride can prevent prostate cancer in healthy men 55 years of age and older. this prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men that took finasteride compared with the group of men that did not. also, the men who took finasteride who did have prostate cancer had more aggressive tumors. the number of deaths from prostate cancer was the same in both groups. men who took finasteride reported more side effects compared with the group of men that did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, and enlarged breasts. the reduction by dutasteride of prostate cancer events trial (reduce) studied whether the drug dutasteride can prevent prostate cancer in men aged 50 to 75 years at higher risk for the disease. this prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men who took dutasteride compared with the group of men that did not. the number of less aggressive prostate cancers was lower, but the number of more aggressive prostate cancers was not. men who took dutasteride reported more side effects than men who did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, less semen, and gynecomastia (enlarged breasts). the following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known: selenium and vitamin e the selenium and vitamin e cancer prevention trial (select) studied whether taking vitamin e and selenium (a mineral) will prevent prostate cancer. the selenium and vitamin e were taken separately or together by healthy men 55 years of age and older (50 years of age and older for african-american men). the study showed that taking selenium alone or selenium and vitamin e together did not decrease the risk of prostate cancer. diet it is not known if decreasing fat or increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet helps decrease the risk of prostate cancer or death from prostate cancer. in the pcpt trial, certain fatty acids increased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer while others decreased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer. multivitamins regular use of multivitamins has not been proven to increase the risk of early or localized prostate cancer. however, a large study showed an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer among men who took multivitamins more than seven times a week. lycopene some studies have shown that a diet high in lycopene may be linked to a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but other studies have not. it has not been proven that taking lycopene supplements decreases the risk of prostate cancer. cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer. cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer. the purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. these may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements. new ways to prevent prostate cancer are being studied in clinical trials. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. information about clinical trials can be found in the clinical trials section of the nci website. check nci's list of cancer clinical trials for prostate cancer prevention trials that are accepting patients.<end>
<question>what is (are) stroke ?<answer>a stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly interrupted or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, spilling blood into the spaces surrounding brain cells. brain cells die when they no longer receive oxygen and nutrients from the blood or there is sudden bleeding into or around the brain. the symptoms of a stroke include sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body; sudden confusion or trouble speaking or understanding speech; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; sudden trouble with walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or coordination; or sudden severe headache with no known cause. there are two forms of stroke: ischemic - blockage of a blood vessel supplying the brain, and hemorrhagic - bleeding into or around the brain.<end>
<question>what are the treatments for skin cancer ?<answer>key points - there are different types of treatment for patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis. - six types of standard treatment are used: - surgery - radiation therapy - chemotherapy - photodynamic therapy - biologic therapy - targeted therapy - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - treatment for skin cancer may cause side effects. - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - follow-up tests may be needed. there are different types of treatment for patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis. different types of treatment are available for patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. six types of standard treatment are used: surgery one or more of the following surgical procedures may be used to treat nonmelanoma skin cancer or actinic keratosis: - mohs micrographic surgery: the tumor is cut from the skin in thin layers. during surgery, the edges of the tumor and each layer of tumor removed are viewed through a microscope to check for cancer cells. layers continue to be removed until no more cancer cells are seen. this type of surgery removes as little normal tissue as possible and is often used to remove skin cancer on the face. - simple excision: the tumor is cut from the skin along with some of the normal skin around it. - shave excision: the abnormal area is shaved off the surface of the skin with a small blade. - electrodesiccation and curettage: the tumor is cut from the skin with a curette (a sharp, spoon-shaped tool). a needle-shaped electrode is then used to treat the area with an electric current that stops the bleeding and destroys cancer cells that remain around the edge of the wound. the process may be repeated one to three times during the surgery to remove all of the cancer. - cryosurgery: a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue, such as carcinoma in situ. this type of treatment is also called cryotherapy. - laser surgery: a surgical procedure that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a surface lesion such as a tumor. - dermabrasion: removal of the top layer of skin using a rotating wheel or small particles to rub away skin cells. radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy: - external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. external radiation therapy is used to treat skin cancer. chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). chemotherapy for nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis is usually topical (applied to the skin in a cream or lotion). the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the condition being treated. retinoids (drugs related to vitamin a) are sometimes used to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. see drugs approved for basal cell carcinoma for more information. photodynamic therapy photodynamic therapy (pdt) is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells. a drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein. the drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells. for skin cancer, laser light is shined onto the skin and the drug becomes active and kills the cancer cells. photodynamic therapy causes little damage to healthy tissue. biologic therapy biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. this type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. interferon and imiquimod are biologic agents used to treat skin cancer. interferon (by injection) may be used to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. topical imiquimod therapy (a cream applied to the skin) may be used to treat some small basal cell carcinomas. see drugs approved for basal cell carcinoma for more information. targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. targeted therapy with a signal transduction inhibitor is used to treat basal cell carcinoma. signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell. blocking these signals may kill cancer cells. vismodegib and sonidegib are signal transduction inhibitors used to treat basal cell carcinoma. see drugs approved for basal cell carcinoma for more information. new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. treatment for skin cancer may cause side effects. for information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our side effects page. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials. follow-up tests may be needed. some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are likely to recur (come back), usually within 5 years, or new tumors may form. talk to your doctor about how often you should have your skin checked for signs of cancer. treatment options for nonmelanoma skin cancer basal cell carcinoma treatment of basal cell carcinoma may include the following: - simple excision. - mohs micrographic surgery. - radiation therapy. - electrodesiccation and curettage. - cryosurgery. - photodynamic therapy. - topical chemotherapy. - topical biologic therapy with imiquimod. - laser surgery. treatment of recurrent basal cell carcinoma is usually mohs micrographic surgery. treatment of basal cell carcinoma that is metastatic or cannot be treated with local therapy may include the following: - targeted therapy with a signal transduction inhibitor. - chemotherapy. - a clinical trial of a new treatment. check the list of nci-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with basal cell carcinoma of the skin. for more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you. general information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. squamous cell carcinoma treatment of squamous cell carcinoma may include the following: - simple excision. -

<question>what are the genetic changes related to lung cancer ?<answer>cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division or the repair of damaged dna. these changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. in nearly all cases of lung cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the lung. these changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in lung cancer cells. mutations in the egfr and kras genes are estimated to be present in up to half of all lung cancer cases. these genes each provide instructions for making a protein that is embedded within the cell membrane. when these proteins are turned on (activated) by binding to other molecules, signaling pathways are triggered within cells that promote cell growth and division (proliferation). mutations in either the egfr or kras gene lead to the production of a protein that is constantly turned on (constitutively activated). as a result, cells are signaled to constantly proliferate, leading to tumor formation. when these gene changes occur in cells in the lungs, lung cancer develops. mutations in many other genes have each been found in a small proportion of cases. in addition to genetic changes, researchers have identified many personal and environmental factors that expose individuals to cancer-causing compounds (carcinogens) and increase the rate at which somatic mutations occur, contributing to a person's risk of developing lung cancer. the greatest risk factor is long-term tobacco smoking, which increases a person's risk of developing lung cancer 20-fold. other risk factors include exposure to air pollution, radon, asbestos, or secondhand smoke; long-term use of hormone replacement therapy for menopause; and a history of lung disease such as tuberculosis, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. a history of lung cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor; however, because relatives with lung cancer were likely smokers, it is unclear whether the increased risk of lung cancer is the result of genetic factors or exposure to secondhand smoke.<end>

<question>what is (are) high blood pressure ?<answer>older adults should limit their sodium (salt) intake to 1,500 mg a day. that's about 2/3 of a teaspoon of salt. here are tips to reduce salt in your diet. - buy fresh, plain frozen, or canned with no salt added vegetables. choose foods packed in water instead of broth or salt. - use fresh poultry, fish, and lean meat, rather than canned or processed types. - use herbs, spices, and salt-free seasoning blends in cooking and at the table. - cook rice, pasta, and hot cereal without salt. cut back on instant or flavored rice, pasta, and cereal mixes, which usually have added salt. - choose convenience foods that are low in sodium. cut back on frozen dinners, pizza, packaged mixes, canned soups or broths, and salad dressingsthese often have a lot of sodium. - rinse canned foods, such as tuna, to remove some sodium. - when available, buy low- or reduced-sodium or no-salt-added versions of foods. - choose ready-to-eat breakfast cereals that are low in sodium. buy fresh, plain frozen, or canned with no salt added vegetables. choose foods packed in water instead of broth or salt. use fresh poultry, fish, and lean meat, rather than canned or processed types. use herbs, spices, and salt-free seasoning blends in cooking and at the table. cook rice, pasta, and hot cereal without salt. cut back on instant or flavored rice, pasta, and cereal mixes, which usually have added salt. choose convenience foods that are low in sodium. cut back on frozen dinners, pizza, packaged mixes, canned soups or broths, and salad dressingsthese often have a lot of sodium. rinse canned foods, such as tuna, to remove some sodium. when available, buy low- or reduced-sodium or no-salt-added versions of foods. choose ready-to-eat breakfast cereals that are low in sodium.<end>
<question>what causes parkinson's disease ?<answer>a shortage of dopamine parkinson's disease occurs when nerve cells, or neurons, in an area of the brain that controls movement become impaired and/or die. normally, these neurons produce an important brain chemical known as dopamine, but when the neurons die or become impaired, they produce less dopamine. this shortage of dopamine causes the movement problems of people with parkinson's. dopamine is a chemical messenger, or neurotransmitter. dopamine is responsible for transmitting signals between the substantia nigra and multiple brain regions. the connection between the substantia nigra and the corpus striatum is critical to produce smooth, purposeful movement. loss of dopamine in this circuit results in abnormal nerve-firing patterns within the brain that cause impaired movement. loss of norepinephrine people with parkinson's also have loss of the nerve endings that produce the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. norepinephrine, which is closely related to dopamine, is the main chemical messenger of the sympathetic nervous system. the sympathetic nervous system controls many automatic functions of the body, such as heart rate and blood pressure. the loss of norepinephrine might help explain several of the non-movement features of parkinson's, such as fatigue, irregular blood pressure, decreased gastric motility or movement of food through the digestive tract, and postural hypotension. postural hypotension is a sudden drop in blood pressure when a person stands up from a sitting or lying-down position. it may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and in some cases, loss of balance or fainting. lewy bodies in brain cells many brain cells of people with parkinson's contain lewy bodies. lewy bodies are unusual deposits or clumps of the brain protein alpha-synuclein, along with other proteins, which are seen upon microscopic examination of the brain. researchers do not yet know why lewy bodies form or what role they play in the development of parkinson's. the clumps may prevent the cell from functioning normally, or they may actually be helpful, perhaps by keeping harmful proteins "locked up" so the cells can function. genetic mutations although some cases of parkinson's appear to be hereditary, and a few can be traced to specific genetic mutations, most cases are sporadic. sporadic means the disease occurs randomly and does not seem to run in families. many researchers now believe that parkinson's disease results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. scientists have identified several genetic mutations associated with parkinson's including mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene. they think that many more genes may be linked to the disorder. studying the genes responsible for inherited cases of parkinson's can help researchers understand both inherited and sporadic cases. the same genes and proteins that are altered in inherited cases may also be altered in sporadic cases by environmental toxins or other factors. researchers also hope that discovering genes will help identify new ways of treating parkinson's. environmental toxins although researchers increasingly recognize the importance of genetics in parkinson's disease, most believe environmental exposures increase a person's risk of developing the disease. even in inherited cases, exposure to toxins or other environmental factors may influence when symptoms of the disease appear or how the disease progresses. there are a number of toxins that can cause parkinsonian symptoms in humans. researchers are pursuing the question of whether pesticides and other environmental factors not yet identified also may cause parkinson's disease. viruses are another possible environmental trigger for parkinson's. mitochondria and free radicals research suggests that mitochondria may play a role in the development of parkinson's disease. mitochondria are the energy-producing components of the cell and are major sources of free radicals. free radicals are molecules that damage membranes, proteins, dna, and other parts of the cell. this damage is called oxidative stress. changes to brain cells caused by oxidative stress, including free radical damage to dna, proteins, and fats, have been found in people with parkinson's. clinical studies now underway test whether agents thought to improve energy metabolism and decrease oxidative stress slow the progression of parkinson's disease. recent evidence suggests that mutations in genes linked to parkinsons disease result in mitochondrial dysfunction. buildup of harmful proteins other research suggests that the cell's protein disposal system may fail in people with parkinson's, causing proteins like alpha-synuclein to build up to harmful levels and trigger premature cell death. additional studies have found that clumps of protein that develop inside brain cells of people with parkinson's may contribute to the death of nerve cells, or neurons. however, the exact role of the protein deposits remains unknown. these studies also found that inflammation, because of protein accumulation, toxins or other factors, may play a role in the disease. however, the exact role of the protein deposits remains unknown. researchers are exploring the possibility of vaccine development to decrease or prevent the accumulation of alpha-synuclein. while mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and many other cellular processes may contribute to parkinson's disease, scientists still do not know what causes cells that produce dopamine to die. genes linked to parkinsons researchers have discovered several genes that are linked to parkinson's disease. the first to be identified was alpha-synuclein or snca . studies have found that lewy bodies from people with the sporadic form of parkinson's contain clumps of alpha-synuclein protein. this discovery revealed a possible link between hereditary and sporadic forms of the disease. other genes linked to parkinson's include park2, park7, pink1, and lrrk2. park2, park7, and pink1 cause rare, early-onset forms of the disease. mutations in the lrrk2 gene are common in specific populations, including in people with parkinson's in north africa. researchers are continuing to study the normal functions and interactions of these genes in order to find clues about how parkinson's develops. they also have identified a number of other genes and chromosome regions that may play a role in parkinson's, but the nature of these links is not yet clear. whole genome wide association studies, or gwas, of thousands of people with parkinson's disease are now underway to find gene variants that allow for an increased risk of developing parkinson's but are not necessarily causes of this disorder by themselves. a recent international study found that two genes containing mutations known to cause rare hereditary forms of parkinsons disease are also associated with the more common sporadic form of the disease. this finding came from a gwas which looked at dna samples of european people who had parkinsons disease and from those who did not have the disorder.<end>
<question>what is (are) wilson disease ?<answer>wilson disease is a rare inherited disorder that is characterized by the accumulation of copper in the body. because high levels of copper are toxic to tissues and organs, this buildup can lead to damage of the liver, brain and eyes. signs and symptoms of wilson disease include chronic liver disease, central nervous system abnormalities, and psychiatric (mental health-related) disturbances. it is caused by a mutation of the atp7b gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. although there is no cure for wilson disease, therapies exist that aim to reduce or control the amount of copper that accumulates in the body.<end>

<question>what are the symptoms of leukemia ?<answer>during the early stages of leukemia, there may be no symptoms. many of the symptoms of leukemia don't become apparent until a large number of normal blood cells are crowded out by leukemia cells. symptoms of chronic and acute leukemia in chronic leukemia, symptoms develop gradually and, in the beginning, are generally not as severe as in acute leukemia. chronic leukemia is usually found during a routine doctor's exam before symptoms are present. when symptoms appear, they generally are mild at first and gradually get worse, but sometimes they don't worsen until many years after an initial diagnosis. recently, researchers discovered that abnormal white blood cells can be present in the blood of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients a number of years before a diagnosis. this finding may lead to a better understanding of the cellular changes that occur in the earliest stages of the disease and how the disease progresses. in acute leukemia, symptoms usually appear and get worse quickly. people with this disease usually go to their doctor because they feel sick. white blood cell levels may be high people with leukemia may have very high levels of white blood cells, but because the cells are abnormal, they are unable to fight infection. therefore, patients may develop frequent fevers or infections. a shortage of red blood cells, called anemia, can cause a person to feel tired. not having enough blood platelets may cause a person to bleed and bruise easily. some symptoms depend on where leukemia cells collect in the body. leukemia cells can collect in many different tissues and organs, such as the digestive tract, kidneys, lungs, lymph nodes, or other parts of the body, including the eyes, brain, and testicles. other common symptoms other common symptoms of leukemia include headache, weight loss, pain in the bones or joints, swelling or discomfort in the abdomen (from an enlarged spleen), and swollen lymph nodes, especially in the neck or armpit. symptoms of acute leukemia may include vomiting, confusion, loss of muscle control, and seizures. some of the symptoms of leukemia are similar to those caused by the flu or other common diseases, so these symptoms are not sure signs of leukemia. it is important to check with your doctor if you have these symptoms. only a doctor can diagnose and treat leukemia. diagnosing leukemia: physical exam, blood tests, biopsy to find the cause of leukemia symptoms, the doctor will ask about medical history and conduct a physical exam. during the exam, the doctor will check for signs of disease such as lumps, swelling in the lymph nodes, spleen, and liver, or anything else that seems unusual. the doctor will need to do blood tests that check the levels and types of blood cells and look for changes in the shape of blood cells. the doctor also may look at certain factors in the blood to see if leukemia has affected other organs such as the liver or kidneys. even if blood tests suggest leukemia, the doctor may look for signs of leukemia in the bone marrow by doing a biopsy before making a diagnosis. a biopsy is a procedure where a small amount of bone marrow is removed from a bone. a pathologist examines the sample under a microscope to look for abnormal cells. there are two ways the doctor can obtain bone marrow. in a bone marrow aspiration, marrow is collected by inserting a needle into the hipbone or another large bone and removing a small amount of bone marrow. a bone marrow biopsy is performed with a larger needle and removes bone marrow and a small piece of bone. if leukemia cells are found if leukemia cells are found in the bone marrow sample, the doctor may perform more tests to determine if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. the doctor may collect a sample of the fluid around the brain and spinal cord by performing a spinal tap and checking for leukemia cells or other signs of problems. computed tomography (ct) scans, and ultrasounds are tests used to determine if leukemia has spread from the bone marrow. these tests produce pictures of the inside of the body. with these tests, the doctor looks for abnormalities such as enlarged organs or signs of infection.<end>
<question>what are the symptoms of osteoporosis ?<answer>fractures -- a possible warning sign osteoporosis does not have any symptoms until a fracture occurs. women and men with osteoporosis most often break bones in the hip, spine, and wrist. but any fracture in an older person could be a warning sign that the bone is weaker than optimal. some people may be unaware that they have already experienced one or more spine fractures. height loss of one inch or more may be the first sign that someone has experienced spine fractures due to osteoporosis. multiple spine fractures can cause a curved spine, stooped posture, back pain, and back fatigue. women and men who have had a fracture are at high risk of experiencing another one. a fracture over the age of 50 or several fractures before that age may be a warning sign that a person has already developed osteoporosis. people over the age of 50 who have experienced a fracture should talk to their doctor about getting evaluated for osteoporosis. risk factors for fractures the more likely you are to fall, the higher your risk for a fracture. and more severe falls increase your risk for fractures. factors that increase your risk of falling and of fracturing a bone include - decreased muscle strength - poor balance - impaired eyesight - impaired mental abilities - certain medications, such as tranquilizers and muscle relaxants - hazardous elements in your living environment, such as slippery throw rugs and icy sidewalks. decreased muscle strength poor balance impaired eyesight impaired mental abilities certain medications, such as tranquilizers and muscle relaxants hazardous elements in your living environment, such as slippery throw rugs and icy sidewalks. the angle at which you fall also affects your risk of fracture. hip fractures although low bone mass (or low bone density) plays an important role in determining a person's risk of osteoporosis, it is only one of many risk factors for fractures. various aspects of bone geometry, such as tallness, hip structure, and thighbone (femur) length, can also affect your chances of breaking a bone if you fall. increasing age, too much weight loss, a history of fractures since age 50, having an existing spine fracture, and having a mother who fractured her hip all increase the risk of hip fracture regardless of a person's bone density. people with more risk factors have a higher chance of suffering a hip fracture.<end>
<question>how to prevent shingles ?<answer>a vaccine for adults 60 and older in may 2006, the u.s. food and drug administration approved a vaccine (zostavax) to prevent shingles in people age 60 and older. the vaccine is designed to boost the immune system and protect older adults from getting shingles later on. even if you have had shingles, you can still get the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. there is no maximum age for getting the vaccine, and only a single dose is recommended. in a clinical trial involving thousands of adults 60 years old or older, the vaccine reduced the risk of shingles by about half. a one-time dose to reduce the risk of shingles, adults 60 years old or older should talk to their healthcare professional about getting a one-time dose of the shingles vaccine. even if the shingles vaccine doesnt prevent you from getting shingles, it can still reduce the chance of having long-term pain. if you have had shingles before, you can still get the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. there is no maximum age for getting the vaccine. side effects vaccine side effects are usually mild and temporary. in most cases, shingles vaccine causes no serious side effects. some people experience mild reactions that last up to a few days, such as headache or redness, soreness, swelling, or itching where the shot was given. when to get the vaccine the decision on when to get vaccinated should be made with your health care provider. the shingles vaccine is not recommended if you have active shingles or pain that continues after the rash is gone. although there is no specific time that you must wait after having shingles before receiving the shingles vaccine, you should generally make sure that the shingles rash has disappeared before getting vaccinated. where to get the vaccine the shingles vaccine is available in doctors offices, pharmacies, workplaces, community health clinics, and health departments. most private health insurance plans cover recommended vaccines. check with your insurance provider for details and for a list of vaccine providers. medicare part d plans cover shingles vaccine, but there may be costs to you depending on your specific plan. if you do not have health insurance, visit www.healthcare.gov to learn more about health insurance options. who should not get the vaccine? you should not get the shingles vaccine if you - have an active case of shingles or have pain that continues after the rash is gone - have ever had a life-threatening or severe allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of the shingles vaccine. tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. - have a weakened immune system because of: -- hiv/aids or another disease that affects the immune system -- treatment with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids -- cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy -- cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma. have an active case of shingles or have pain that continues after the rash is gone have ever had a life-threatening or severe allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of the shingles vaccine. tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. have a weakened immune system because of: -- hiv/aids or another disease that affects the immune system -- treatment with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids -- cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy -- cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma. - are pregnant or might be pregnant. are pregnant or might be pregnant. to learn more about the vaccine, see zostavax: questions and answers. could vaccines make shingles a rare disease? the shingles vaccine is basically a stronger version of the chickenpox vaccine, which became available in 1995. the chickenpox shot prevents chickenpox in 70 to 90 percent of those vaccinated, and 95 percent of the rest have only mild symptoms. millions of children and adults have already received the chickenpox shot. interestingly, the chickenpox vaccine may reduce the shingles problem. widespread use of the chickenpox vaccine means that fewer people will get chickenpox in the future. and if people do not get chickenpox, they cannot get shingles. use of the shingles and chickenpox vaccines may one day make shingles a rare disease. to find out more, visit shingles vaccination: what you need to know or shingles vaccine)<end>
<question>how to diagnose polycythemia vera ?<answer>special blood tests are used to diagnose polycythemia vera. in addition to a complete blood count, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and cytogenetic analysis, a serum erythropoietin test is used to diagnose polycythemia vera. in this test, a sample of blood is checked for the level of erythropoietin (a hormone that stimulates new red blood cells to be made). in polycythemia vera, the erythropoietin level would be lower than normal because the body does not need to make more red blood cells.<end>
<question>how to prevent diabetes ?<answer>the two most common forms of diabetes are type 1 and type 2. currently, there is no way to delay or prevent type 1 diabetes. however, research has shown that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed in people at risk for the disease. preventing type 2 diabetes can mean a healthier and longer life without serious complications from the disease such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, and amputations. preventing type 2 diabetes before people develop type 2 diabetes, they usually have prediabetes -- a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not yet high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. the good news is that if you have prediabetes, there are ways to reduce your risk of getting type 2 diabetes. with modest weight loss and moderate physical activity, you can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes benefits of weight loss and exercise the diabetes prevention program (dpp) is a landmark study by the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases. dpp researchers found that adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes were able to cut their risk in half by losing a modest amount of weight and being active almost every day. this means losing 5 to 7 percent of body weight (that's 10 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds) and getting 150 minutes of physical activity a week. the drug metformin reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by 34 percent but was more effective in younger and heavier adults. (watch the video to learn more about preventing type 2 diabetes. to enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. to reduce the video, press the escape (esc) button on your keyboard.) the benefits of weight loss and regular exercise have long-lasting value. in a dpp follow-up trial known as the diabetes prevention program outcome study (dppos), people at risk of type 2 diabetes who kept off the weight they had lost and who continued to exercise regularly delayed the onset of type 2 diabetes by about 4 years. the dpp study also showed that modest weight loss (achieved by following a low calorie, low-fat diet) and moderate physical activity were especially effective in preventing or delaying the development of diabetes in older people. in fact, people over the age of 60 were able to reduce their risk for developing type 2 diabetes by 71 percent. how to lower your risk making modest lifestyle changes can help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people who are at risk. here are some tips. reach and maintain a reasonable body weight your weight affects your health in many ways. being overweight can keep your body from making and using insulin properly. it can also cause high blood pressure. the body mass index chart (seen here) can be used to find out whether someone is normal weight, overweight, or obese. body mass index is a measurement of body weight relative to height for adults age 20 or older. to use the chart - find the person's height in the left-hand column - move across the row to find the number closest to the person's weight - find the number at the top of that column - the number at the top of the column is the persons bmi. find the person's height in the left-hand column move across the row to find the number closest to the person's weight find the number at the top of that column the number at the top of the column is the persons bmi. the words above the bmi number indicate whether the person is normal weight, overweight, or obese. people who are overweight or obese should consider talking with a health care provider about ways to lose weight and reduce the risk of diabetes. the bmi has certain limitations. the bmi may overestimate body fat in athletes and others who have a muscular build and underestimate body fat in older adults and others who have lost muscle. waist measurement. in addition to weight, the location of excess fat on the body can be important. a waist measurement of 40 inches or more for men and 35 inches or more for women is linked to insulin resistance and increases a persons risk for type 2 diabetes. this is true even if a persons body mass index (bmi) falls within the normal range. to measure the waist, a person should - place a tape measure around the bare abdomen just above the hip bone - make sure the tape is snug but isnt digging into the skin and is parallel to the floor - relax, exhale, and measure. place a tape measure around the bare abdomen just above the hip bone make sure the tape is snug but isnt digging into the skin and is parallel to the floor relax, exhale, and measure. make healthy food choices what you eat has a big impact on your weight and overall health. by developing healthy eating habits, you can help manage your body weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol. reducing portion size, increasing the amount of fiber you consume (by eating more fruits and vegetables) and limiting fatty and salty foods are key to a healthy diet. here are more tips for eating well with diabetes. - make a diabetes meal plan with help from your health care team. - choose foods that are lower in calories, saturated fat, trans fat, sugar, and salt. - eat foods with more fiber, such as whole grain cereals, breads, crackers, rice, or pasta. - choose foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, bread and cereals, and low-fat or skim milk and cheese. - drink water instead of juice and regular soda. - when eating a meal, fill half of your plate with fruits and vegetables, one quarter with a lean protein, such as beans, or chicken or turkey without the skin, and one quarter with a whole grain, such as brown rice or whole wheat pasta. make a diabetes meal plan with help from your health care team. choose foods that are lower in calories, saturated fat, trans fat, sugar, and salt. eat foods with more fiber, such as whole grain cereals, breads, crackers, rice, or pasta. choose foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, bread and cereals, and low-fat or skim milk and cheese. drink water instead of juice and regular soda. when eating a meal, fill half of your plate with fruits and vegetables, one quarter with a lean protein, such as beans, or chicken or turkey without the skin, and one quarter with a whole grain, such as brown rice or whole wheat pasta. for more about healthy eating and older adults see "eating well as you get older." be physically active get at least 30 minutes of exercise at least five days a week. regular exercise reduces diabetes risk in several ways. it -

<question>what is (are) polycystic kidney disease ?<answer>autosomal recessive pkd is a rare genetic disorder that affects the liver as well as the kidneys. the signs of autosomal recessive pkd frequently appear in the earliest months of life, even in the womb, so health care providers often call it infantile pkd. in an autosomal recessive disorder, the child has to inherit the gene mutation from both parents to have an increased likelihood for the disorder. the chance of a child inheriting autosomal recessive mutations from both parents with a gene mutation is 25 percent, or one in four. if only one parent carries the mutated gene, the child will not get the disorder, although the child may inherit the gene mutation. the child is a carrier of the disorder and can pass the gene mutation to the next generation. genetic testing can show whether a parent or child is a carrier of the mutated gene. autosomal recessive disorders do not typically appear in every generation of an affected family. the following chart shows the chance of inheriting an autosomal recessive mutation from parents who both carry the mutated gene: read more about how people inherit genetic conditions at the nlms genetics home reference.<end>
<question>what is (are) rheumatoid arthritis ?<answer>rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is a form of arthritis that causes pain, swelling, stiffness and loss of function in your joints. it can affect any joint but is common in the wrist and fingers. more women than men get rheumatoid arthritis. it often starts in middle age and is most common in older people. you might have the disease for only a short time, or symptoms might come and go. the severe form can last a lifetime. rheumatoid arthritis is different from osteoarthritis, the common arthritis that often comes with older age. ra can affect body parts besides joints, such as your eyes, mouth and lungs. ra is an autoimmune disease, which means the arthritis results from your immune system attacking your body's own tissues. no one knows what causes rheumatoid arthritis. genes, environment, and hormones might contribute. treatments include medicine, lifestyle changes, and surgery. these can slow or stop joint damage and reduce pain and swelling. nih: national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases<end>
<question>how to diagnose alagille syndrome ?<answer>a health care provider diagnoses alagille syndrome by performing a thorough physical exam and ordering one or more of the following tests and exams: - blood test - urinalysis - x ray - abdominal ultrasound - cardiology exam - slit-lamp exam - liver biopsy - genetic testing alagille syndrome can be difficult to diagnose because the signs and symptoms vary and the syndrome is so rare. for a diagnosis of alagille syndrome, three of the following symptoms typically should be present: - liver symptoms, such as jaundice, pruritus, malabsorption, and xanthomas - heart abnormalities or murmurs - skeletal abnormalities - posterior embryotoxon - facial features typical of alagille syndrome - kidney disease - blood vessel problems a health care provider may perform a liver biopsy to diagnose alagille syndrome; however, it is not necessary to make a diagnosis. a diagnosis can be made in a person who does not meet the clinical criteria of alagille syndrome yet does have a gene mutation of jag1. the health care provider may have a blood sample tested to look for the jag1 gene mutation. the gene mutation can be identified in 94 percent of people with a diagnosis of alagille syndrome.2 blood test. a blood test involves drawing blood at a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. the blood test can show nutritional status and the presence of liver disease and kidney function. urinalysis. urinalysis is the testing of a urine sample. the urine sample is collected in a special container in a health care provider's office or a commercial facility and can be tested in the same location or sent to a lab for analysis. urinalysis can show many problems of the urinary tract and other body systems. the sample may be observed for color, cloudiness, or concentration; signs of drug use; chemical composition, including glucose; the presence of protein, blood cells, or bacteria; or other signs of disease. x ray. an x ray is a picture created by using radiation and recorded on film or on a computer. the amount of radiation used is small. an x-ray technician performs the x ray at a hospital or an outpatient center, and a radiologista doctor who specializes in medical imaginginterprets the images. anesthesia is not needed. the patient will lie on a table or stand during the x ray. the technician positions the x-ray machine over the spine area to look for "butterfly" vertebrae. the patient will hold his or her breath as the picture is taken so that the picture will not be blurry. the patient may be asked to change position for additional pictures. abdominal ultrasound. ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. the transducer can be moved to different angles to make it possible to examine different organs. in abdominal ultrasound, the health care provider applies a gel to the patient's abdomen and moves a handheld transducer over the skin. the gel allows the transducer to glide easily, and it improves the transmission of the signals. a specially trained technician performs the procedure in a health care provider's office, an outpatient center, or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images; anesthesia is not needed. the images can show an enlarged liver or rule out other conditions. cardiology exam. a cardiologista doctor who treats people who have heart problemsperforms a cardiology exam in a health care provider's office, an outpatient center, or a hospital. during a full exam, a cardiologist may inspect the patient's physical appearance, measure pulse rate and blood pressure, observe the jugular vein, check for rapid or skipped heartbeats, listen for variations in heart sounds, and listen to the lungs. slit-lamp exam. an ophthalmologista doctor who diagnoses and treats all eye diseases and eye disordersperforms a slit-lamp exam to diagnose posterior embryotoxon. the ophthalmologist examines the eye with a slit lamp, a microscope combined with a high-intensity light that shines a thin beam on the eye. while sitting in a chair, the patient will rest his or her head on the slit lamp. a yellow dye may be used to examine the cornea and tear layer. the dye is applied as a drop, or the specialist may touch a strip of paper stained with the dye to the white of the patient's eye. the specialist will also use drops in the patient's eye to dilate the pupil. liver biopsy. a liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a piece of liver tissue for examination with a microscope for signs of damage or disease. the health care provider may ask the patient to stop taking certain medications temporarily before the liver biopsy. the patient may be asked to fast for 8 hours before the procedure. during the procedure, the patient lies on a table, right hand resting above the head. a local anesthetic is applied to the area where the biopsy needle will be inserted. if needed, sedatives and pain medication are also given. the health care provider uses a needle to take a small piece of liver tissue. the health care provider may use ultrasound, computerized tomography scans, or other imaging techniques to guide the needle. after the biopsy, the patient should lie on the right side for up to 2 hours and is monitored an additional 2 to 4 hours before being sent home. genetic testing. the health care provider may refer a person suspected of having alagille syndrome to a geneticista doctor who specializes in genetic disorders. for a genetic test, the geneticist takes a blood or saliva sample and analyzes the dna for the jag1 gene mutation. the geneticist tests for the jag1 gene mutation first, since it is more common in alagille syndrome than notch2. genetic testing is often done only by specialized labs. the results may not be available for several months because of the complexity of the testing. the usefulness of genetic testing for alagille syndrome is limited by two factors: - detection of a mutated gene cannot predict the onset of symptoms or how serious the disorder will be. - even if a mutated gene is found, no specific cure for the disorder exists. when to consider genetic counseling people who are considering genetic testing may want to consult a genetics counselor. genetic counseling can help family members understand how test results may affect them individually and as a family. genetic counseling is provided by genetics professionalshealth care professionals with specialized degrees and experience in medical genetics and counseling. genetics professionals include geneticists, genetics counselors, and genetics nurses. genetics professionals work as members of health care teams, providing information and support to individuals or families who have genetic disorders or a higher chance of having an inherited condition. genetics professionals - assess the likelihood of a genetic disorder by researching a family's history, evaluating medical records, and conducting a physical exam of the patient and other family members - weigh the medical, social, and ethical decisions surrounding genetic testing - provide support and information to help a person make a decision about testing - interpret the results of genetic tests and medical data - provide counseling or refer individuals and families to support services - serve as patient advocates - explain possible treatments or preventive measures - discuss reproductive options genetic counseling may be useful when a family member is deciding whether to have genetic testing and again later when test results are available.<end>
<question>what is (are) alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency ?<answer>alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder that may cause lung disease and liver disease. the signs and symptoms of the condition and the age at which they appear vary among individuals. people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency usually develop the first signs and symptoms of lung disease between ages 20 and 50. the earliest symptoms are shortness of breath following mild activity, reduced ability to exercise, and wheezing. other signs and symptoms can include unintentional weight loss, recurring respiratory infections, fatigue, and rapid heartbeat upon standing. affected individuals often develop emphysema, which is a lung disease caused by damage to the small air sacs in the lungs (alveoli). characteristic features of emphysema include difficulty breathing, a hacking cough, and a barrel-shaped chest. smoking or exposure to tobacco smoke accelerates the appearance of emphysema symptoms and damage to the lungs. about 10 percent of infants with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop liver disease, which often causes yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). approximately 15 percent of adults with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop liver damage (cirrhosis) due to the formation of scar tissue in the liver. signs of cirrhosis include a swollen abdomen, swollen feet or legs, and jaundice. individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are also at risk of developing a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma. in rare cases, people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop a skin condition called panniculitis, which is characterized by hardened skin with painful lumps or patches. panniculitis varies in severity and can occur at any age.<end>
<question>how to prevent cyclic vomiting syndrome ?<answer>a person should stay away from known triggers, especially during the well phase, as well as - get adequate sleep to prevent exhaustion - treat sinus problems or allergies - seek help on reducing stress and anxiety - avoid foods that trigger episodes or foods with additives a health care provider may refer people with cyclic vomiting syndrome and anxiety to a stress management specialist for relaxation therapy or other treatments. a health care provider may prescribe medications to prevent migraines for people with cyclic vomiting syndrome.<end>
<question>what are the treatments for kidney disease ?<answer>dialysis is a treatment to filter wastes and water from your blood. there are two major forms of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. (watch the video to learn more about dialysis. to enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. to reduce the video, press the escape (esc) button on your keyboard.) in hemodialysis, blood is run through a filter outside of your body and the clean blood is returned to the body. hemodialysis is usually done at a dialysis center three times a week, but it can also be done at home. each session usually lasts between three and four hours. peritoneal dialysis is another way to remove wastes from your blood. this kind of dialysis uses the lining of your abdominal cavity (the space in your body that holds organs like the stomach, intestines, and liver) to filter your blood. it works by putting a special fluid into your abdomen that absorbs waste products in your blood as it passes through small blood vessels in this lining. this fluid is then drained away. a key benefit of peritoneal dialysis is that it can be done at home, while you sleep. get more information about dialysis.<end>
<question>who is at risk for cataract? ?<answer>as with any surgery, cataract surgery poses risks such as infection and bleeding. before cataract surgery, your doctor may ask you to temporarily stop taking certain medications that increase the risk of bleeding during surgery. after surgery, you must keep your eye clean, wash your hands before touching your eye, and use the prescribed medications to help minimize the risk of infection. serious infection can result in loss of vision. cataract surgery slightly increases your risk of retinal detachment. other eye disorders, such as nearsightedness, can further increase your risk of retinal detachment after cataract surgery. a retinal detachment causes no pain. early treatment for retinal detachment often can prevent permanent loss of vision. the longer the retina stays detached, the less likely you will regain good vision once you are treated. even if you are treated promptly, some vision may be lost. talk to your eye care professional about these risks. make sure cataract surgery is right for you.<end>
<question>what are the genetic changes related to restless legs syndrome ?<answer>restless legs syndrome likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, many of which are unknown. studies suggest that restless legs syndrome is related to a shortage (deficiency) of iron in certain parts of the brain. iron is involved in several critical activities in brain cells, including the production of a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) called dopamine. among its many functions, dopamine triggers signals within the nervous system that help the brain control physical movement. researchers believe that malfunction of the dopamine signaling system may underlie the abnormal movements in people with restless legs syndrome. however, it is unclear how iron deficiency is related to abnormal dopamine signaling, or how these changes in the brain lead to the particular signs and symptoms of the condition. variations in several genes have been studied as risk factors for restless legs syndrome. most of these genes are thought to be involved in the development of nerve cells (neurons) before birth. it is unclear whether any of the genes play roles in brain iron levels or in dopamine signaling. variations in known genes appear to account for only a small percentage of the risk of developing restless legs syndrome. changes in other genes, which have not been identified, probably also contribute to this complex disorder. researchers suspect that the early-onset form of restless legs syndrome is more likely than the late-onset form to have a genetic basis. nongenetic factors are also thought to play a role in restless legs syndrome. for example, several other disorders increase the risk of developing the condition. these include a life-threatening failure of kidney function called end-stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and parkinson disease. people with low iron levels associated with a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and women who are pregnant are also more likely to develop restless legs syndrome. in these cases, the condition usually improves or goes away when iron levels increase or after the woman gives birth. restless legs syndrome can be triggered by medications, including certain drugs used to treat nausea, depression and other mental health disorders, colds and allergies, heart problems, and high blood pressure. use of caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol can also trigger restless legs syndrome or make the signs and symptoms worse. in these cases, the condition usually improves or goes away once a person stops using these medications or substances.<end>
<question>what is (are) dry mouth ?<answer>you should avoid sticky and sugary foods. if you do eat them, brush immediately afterwards. also, be aware that spicy and salty foods can cause pain in a dry mouth. you should also avoid drinks with caffeine and alcohol. they can dry out the mouth.<end>
<question>what are the treatments for celiac disease ?<answer>most people with celiac disease have a significant improvement in symptoms when they follow a gluten-free diet. health care providers typically refer people to a dietitian who specializes in treating people with the disease. the dietitian will teach the person to avoid gluten while following a healthy and nutritious diet. the dietitian will give the person instructions for how to - read food and product labels and identify ingredients that contain gluten - make healthy choices about the types of foods to eat - design everyday meal plans for most people, following a gluten-free diet will stop symptoms, heal existing intestinal damage, and prevent further damage. symptoms may improve within days to weeks of starting the diet. the small intestine usually heals in 3 to 6 months in children. complete healing can take several years in adults. once the intestine heals, the villi will absorb nutrients from food into the bloodstream normally. some people with celiac disease show no improvement after starting a gluten-free diet. the most common reason for poor response to dietary changes is that people are still consuming small amounts of gluten, which can damage the small intestineeven in people without symptoms. most people start responding to the gluten-free diet once they find and eliminate hidden sources of gluten from their diet. hidden sources of gluten include additives made with wheat, such as - modified food starch - preservatives - stabilizers did you know that medications and nonfood products may contain gluten? medications, supplements, and other products may also contain lecithin, a hidden source of gluten. people with celiac disease should ask a pharmacist about the ingredients in - prescription and over-the-counter medications - vitamins and mineral supplements - herbal and nutritional supplements other products can be ingested or transferred from a person's hands to his or her mouth. reading product labels can help people avoid gluten exposure. if a product's label does not list its ingredients, the manufacturer should provide a list upon request. products that can contain gluten include - lipstick, lip gloss, and lip balm - cosmetics - skin and hair products - toothpaste and mouthwash - glue on stamps and envelopes - children's modeling dough, such as play-doh some people who continue to have symptoms even after changing their diet may have other conditions or disorders that are more common in people with celiac disease. these conditions may include - small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, which happens when too many bacteria grow in the small intestine - pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, in which the pancreas does not produce enough digestive juice - microscopic colitis, an inflammation of the colon that a health care provider can see only with a microscope - ibs - lactose intolerance, a condition in which people have symptoms after consuming milk or milk products - other food intolerances, which may occur because of continued damage to the intestine in some cases, people continue to have difficulty absorbing nutrients despite following a strict gluten-free diet. people with this condition, known as refractory celiac disease, have severely damaged intestines that cannot heal. their intestines are not absorbing enough nutrients, so they may need to receive nutrients intravenously. researchers continue to evaluate medications to treat refractory celiac disease. depending on a person's age at diagnosis, some complications of celiac disease will not improve, such as short stature and dental enamel defects. for people with dermatitis herpetiformis, skin symptoms generally respond to a gluten-free diet and may recur if a person adds gluten back into his or her diet. medications such as dapsone can control the rash's symptoms. dapsone does not treat intestinal symptoms or damage, so people with dermatitis herpetiformis should maintain a gluten-free diet, even if they don't have digestive symptoms. even when a person follows a gluten-free diet, the skin lesions from dermatitis herpetiformis may take months or even years to fully heal and often recur over the years.<end>
<question>what are the symptoms of copd ?<answer>call your doctor right away if your symptoms worsen suddenly. people with copd may have symptoms that suddenly get worse. when this happens, you have a much harder time catching your breath. symptoms that worsen suddenly can include sudden chest tightness, more coughing, a change in your sputum (mucus), or fever. your doctor will look at things that may be causing these sudden symptoms. sometimes the symptoms are caused by a lung infection.<end>
<question>what are the treatments for balance problems ?<answer>mnire's disease is caused by changes in fluid volumes in the inner ear. people with mnire's disease can help reduce its dizzying effects by lowering the amount of salt (sodium) in their diets. limiting alcohol or caffeine also may be helpful. some medications, such as corticosteroids or the antibiotic gentamicin, also are used to treat mnire's disease. although gentamicin can help reduce the dizziness that occurs with mnire's disease, it occasionally destroys sensory cells in the inner ear, which can result in permanent hearing loss. corticosteroids don't cause hearing loss; however, research is underway to determine if they are as effective as gentamicin learn more about the treatments for mnire's disease.<end>
<question>what are the treatments for porphyria ?<answer>treatment for porphyria depends on the type of porphyria the person has and the severity of the symptoms. acute porphyrias a health care provider treats acute porphyrias with heme or glucose loading to decrease the livers production of porphyrins and porphyrin precursors. a patient receives heme intravenously once a day for 4 days. glucose loading involves giving a patient a glucose solution by mouth or intravenously. heme is usually more effective and is the treatment of choice unless symptoms are mild. in rare instances, if symptoms are severe, a health care provider will recommend liver transplantation to treat acute porphyria. in liver transplantation, a surgeon removes a diseased or an injured liver and replaces it with a healthy, whole liver or a segment of a liver from another person, called a donor. a patient has liver transplantation surgery in a hospital under general anesthesia. liver transplantation can cure liver failure. more information is provided in the niddk health topic, liver transplantation. cutaneous porphyrias the most important step a person can take to treat a cutaneous porphyria is to avoid sunlight as much as possible. other cutaneous porphyrias are treated as follows: - porphyria cutanea tarda. a health care provider treats porphyria cutanea tarda by removing factors that tend to activate the disease and by performing repeated therapeutic phlebotomies to reduce iron in the liver. therapeutic phlebotomy is the removal of about a pint of blood from a vein in the arm. a technician performs the procedure at a blood donation center, such as a hospital, clinic, or bloodmobile. a patient does not require anesthesia. another treatment approach is low-dose hydroxychloroquine tablets to reduce porphyrins in the liver. - erythropoietic protoporphyria. people with erythropoietic protoporphyria may be given beta-carotene or cysteine to improve sunlight tolerance, though these medications do not lower porphyrin levels. experts recommend hepatitis a and b vaccines and avoiding alcohol to prevent protoporphyric liver failure. a health care provider may use liver transplantation or a combination of medications to treat people who develop liver failure. unfortunately, liver transplantation does not correct the primary defect, which is the continuous overproduction of protoporphyria by bone marrow. successful bone marrow transplantations may successfully cure erythropoietic protoporphyria. a health care provider only considers bone marrow transplantation if the disease is severe and leading to secondary liver disease. - congenital erythropoietic porphyria and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria. people with congenital erythropoietic porphyria or hepatoerythropoietic porphyria may need surgery to remove the spleen or blood transfusions to treat anemia. a surgeon removes the spleen in a hospital, and a patient receives general anesthesia. with a blood transfusion, a patient receives blood through an intravenous (iv) line inserted into a vein. a technician performs the procedure at a blood donation center, and a patient does not need anesthesia. secondary porphyrinurias conditions called secondary porphyrinurias, such as disorders of the liver and bone marrow, as well as a number of drugs, chemicals, and toxins are often mistaken for porphyria because they lead to mild or moderate increases in porphyrin levels in the urine. only highnot mild or moderatelevels of porphyrin or porphyrin precursors lead to a diagnosis of porphyria.<end>
<question>what are the genetic changes related to ewing sarcoma ?<answer>the most common mutation that causes ewing sarcoma involves two genes, the ewsr1 gene on chromosome 22 and the fli1 gene on chromosome 11. a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosomes 22 and 11, written as t(11;22), fuses part of the ewsr1 gene with part of the fli1 gene, creating the ewsr1/fli1 fusion gene. this mutation is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in tumor cells. this type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited. the protein produced from the ewsr1/fli1 fusion gene, called ews/fli, has functions of the protein products of both genes. the fli protein, produced from the fli1 gene, attaches (binds) to dna and regulates an activity called transcription, which is the first step in the production of proteins from genes. the fli protein controls the growth and development of some cell types by regulating the transcription of certain genes. the ews protein, produced from the ewsr1 gene, also regulates transcription. the ews/fli protein has the dna-binding function of the fli protein as well as the transcription regulation function of the ews protein. it is thought that the ews/fli protein turns the transcription of a variety of genes on and off abnormally. this dysregulation of transcription leads to uncontrolled growth and division (proliferation) and abnormal maturation and survival of cells, causing tumor development. the ewsr1/fli1 fusion gene occurs in approximately 85 percent of ewing sarcomas. translocations that fuse the ewsr1 gene with other genes that are related to the fli1 gene can also cause these types of tumors, although these alternative translocations are relatively uncommon. the fusion proteins produced from the less common gene translocations have the same function as the ews/fli protein.<end>
<question>what causes gout ?<answer>most people with gout have too much uric acid in their blood, a condition called hyperuricemia. uric acid is a substance that results from the breakdown of purines, which are part of all human tissue and are found in many foods, especially those high in protein. needle-like crystals of uric acid can build up in the connective tissue, in the joint space between two bones, or both. if too many uric acid crystals form as a result of hyperuricemia, gout can develop.<end>
<question>what is (are) tay-sachs disease ?<answer>tay-sachs disease is a inherited metabolic disease caused by the harmful buildup of lipids (fatty materials such as oils and acids) in various cells and tissues in the body. it is part of a group of genetic disorders called the gm2 gangliosidoses. tay-sachs and its variant form are caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hexosaminidase a. affected children appear to develop normally until about age 6 months. then, symptoms begin and include progressive loss of mental ability, dementia, blindness, increased startle reflex to noise, progressive loss of hearing leading to deafness, and difficulty with swallowing. seizures may begin in the child's second year. persons with tay-sachs also have "cherry-red" spots in their eyes.a much rarer form of the disorder, called late-onset tay-sachs disease, occurs in individuals in their twenties and early thirties and is characterized by an unsteady gait and progressive neurological deterioration. the incidence of tay-sachs has been particularly high among people of eastern european and askhenazi jewish descent., as well as in certain french canadians and louisiana cajuns. affected individuals and carriers of tay-sachs disease can be identified by a blood test that measures hexosaminidase a activity. both parents must carry the mutated gene in order to have an affected child. in these instances, there is a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy that the child will be affected with tay-sachs disease. prenatal diagnosis is available if desired. a very severe form of tay-sachs disease is know as sandhoff disease, which is not limited to any ethnic group.<end>
<question>what is (are) tourette syndrome ?<answer>tourette syndrome (ts) is a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive, stereotyped, involuntary movements and vocalizations called tics. the first symptoms of ts are almost always noticed in childhood. some of the more common tics include eye blinking and other vision irregularities, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, and head or shoulder jerking. perhaps the most dramatic and disabling tics are those that result in self-harm such as punching oneself in the face, or vocal tics including coprolalia (uttering swear words) or echolalia (repeating the words or phrases of others). many with ts experience additional neurobehavioral problems including inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms such as intrusive thoughts/worries and repetitive behaviors.<end>
<question>what is (are) glaucoma ?<answer>open-angle glaucoma is the most common form of glaucoma. in the normal eye, the clear fluid leaves the anterior chamber at the open angle where the cornea and iris meet. when the fluid reaches the angle, it flows through a spongy meshwork, like a drain, and leaves the eye. sometimes, when the fluid reaches the angle, it passes too slowly through the meshwork drain, causing the pressure inside the eye to build. if the pressure damages the optic nerve, open-angle glaucoma -- and vision loss -- may result.<end>
<question>what is (are) prescription and illicit drug abuse ?<answer>marijuana is the most abused illicit drug among people 50 and older.<end>
<question>what is (are) ulcerative colitis ?<answer>ulcerative colitis is a chronic, or long lasting, disease that causes inflammationirritation or swellingand sores called ulcers on the inner lining of the large intestine. ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract, called inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). crohn's disease and microscopic colitis are the other common ibds. more information is provided in the niddk health topics, crohn's disease and microscopic colitis: collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis. ulcerative colitis most often begins gradually and can become worse over time. symptoms can be mild to severe. most people have periods of remissiontimes when symptoms disappearthat can last for weeks or years. the goal of care is to keep people in remission long term. most people with ulcerative colitis receive care from a gastroenterologist, a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases.<end>
<question>what is (are) medicare and continuing care ?<answer>people who choose original medicare may wish to consider medigap, a type of medicare supplement insurance. medigap policies are sold by private insurance companies to fill gaps in original medicare plan coverage, such as out-of-pocket costs for medicare co-insurance and deductibles, or for services not covered by medicare. a medigap policy only works with original medicare. a person who joins a medicare advantage plan generally doesn't need (and can't use) a medigap policy. for more information about medigap policies, visit http://www.medicare.gov to view a copy of "choosing a medigap policy: a guide to health insurance for people with medicare." (under "search tools," select "find a medicare publication.") you can also call 1-800-medicare (1-800-633-4227). tty users should call 1-877-486-2048.<end>
<question>what are the treatments for cushing's syndrome ?<answer>treatment of cushing's syndrome depends on the cause of excess cortisol. if the cause is long-term use of a medication being used to treat another disorder, the physician may reduce the dosage until symptoms are under control. surgery or radiotherapy may be used to treat pituitary adenomas. surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these may be used to treat ectopic acth syndrome. the aim of surgical treatment is to cure hypercortisolism by removing the tumor while minimizing the chance of endocrine deficiency or long-term dependence on medications. the u.s. food and drug administration has approved pasireotide diasparate, taken by injection, for individuals who cannot be helped through surgery.<end>
<question>who is at risk for marfan syndrome? ?<answer>people at highest risk for marfan syndrome are those who have a family history of the condition. if you have marfan syndrome, you have a 50 percent chance of passing the altered gene to each of your children. marfan syndrome affects about 1 out of every 5,000 people in the united states. men, women, and children, and people of all races, can have the condition.<end>
<question>what is (are) autoimmune hepatitis ?<answer>autoimmune diseases are disorders in which the body's immune system attacks the body's own cells and organs with proteins called autoantibodies; this process is called autoimmunity. the body's immune system normally makes large numbers of proteins called antibodies to help the body fight off infections. in some cases, however, the body makes autoantibodies. certain environmental triggers can lead to autoimmunity. environmental triggers are things originating outside the body, such as bacteria, viruses, toxins, and medications.<end>
<question>how to diagnose lactose intolerance ?<answer>a health care provider makes a diagnosis of lactose intolerance based on - medical, family, and diet history, including a review of symptoms - a physical exam - medical tests medical, family, and diet history. a health care provider will take a medical, family, and diet history to help diagnose lactose intolerance. during this discussion, the health care provider will review a patients symptoms. however, basing a diagnosis on symptoms alone may be misleading because digestive symptoms can occur for many reasons other than lactose intolerance. for example, other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or small bowel bacterial overgrowth can cause digestive symptoms. physical exam. a physical exam may help diagnose lactose intolerance or rule out other conditions that cause digestive symptoms. during a physical exam, a health care provider usually - checks for abdominal bloating - uses a stethoscope to listen to sounds within the abdomen - taps on the abdomen to check for tenderness or pain a health care provider may recommend eliminating all milk and milk products from a persons diet for a short time to see if the symptoms resolve. symptoms that go away when a person eliminates lactose from his or her diet may confirm the diagnosis of lactose intolerance. medical tests. a health care provider may order special tests to provide more information. health care providers commonly use two tests to measure how well a person digests lactose: - hydrogen breath test. this test measures the amount of hydrogen in a persons breath. normally, only a small amount of hydrogen is detectable in the breath when a person eats or drinks and digests lactose. however, undigested lactose produces high levels of hydrogen. for this test, the patient drinks a beverage that contains a known amount of lactose. a health care provider asks the patient to breathe into a balloon-type container that measures breath hydrogen level. in most cases, a health care provider performs this test at a hospital, on an outpatient basis. smoking and some foods and medications may affect the accuracy of the results. a health care provider will tell the patient what foods or medications to avoid before the test. - stool acidity test. undigested lactose creates lactic acid and other fatty acids that a stool acidity test can detect in a stool sample. health care providers sometimes use this test to check acidity in the stools of infants and young children. a child may also have glucose in his or her stool as a result of undigested lactose. the health care provider will give the childs parent or caretaker a container for collecting the stool specimen. the parent or caretaker returns the sample to the health care provider, who sends it to a lab for analysis.<end>

<question>how many people are affected by multiple sclerosis ?<answer>an estimated 1.1 to 2.5 million people worldwide have multiple sclerosis. although the reason is unclear, this condition is more common in regions that are farther away from the equator. in canada, parts of the northern united states, western and northern europe, russia, and southeastern australia, the condition affects approximately 1 in 2,000 to 2,400 people. it is less common closer to the equator, such as in asia, sub-saharan africa, and parts of south america, where about 1 in 20,000 people are affected. for unknown reasons, most forms of multiple sclerosis affect women twice as often as men; however, women and men are equally affected by primary progressive ms.<end>
<question>how to diagnose problems with taste ?<answer>doctors can diagnose a taste disorder by measuring the lowest concentration of a substance that a person can detect. the doctor may also ask a patient to compare the tastes of different substances or to note how the intensity of a taste grows when a substance's concentration is increased. scientists have developed taste tests in which a person responds to different concentrations of a substance. this may involve a simple "sip, spit, and rinse" test, or the application of a substance directly to the tongue with an eye dropper. by using these tests, your doctor can determine if you have a true taste disorder and what type it is.<end>

<question>what are the treatments for endometrial cancer ?<answer>key points - there are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial cancer. - five types of standard treatment are used: - surgery - radiation therapy - chemotherapy - hormone therapy - targeted therapy - new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - follow-up tests may be needed. there are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial cancer. different types of treatment are available for patients with endometrial cancer. some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. a treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. when clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. five types of standard treatment are used: surgery surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is the most common treatment for endometrial cancer. the following surgical procedures may be used: - total hysterectomy: surgery to remove the uterus, including the cervix. if the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy. if the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy. if the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy. - bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes. - radical hysterectomy: surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, and part of the vagina. the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or nearby lymph nodes may also be removed. - lymph node dissection: a surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the pelvic area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. this procedure is also called lymphadenectomy. even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy or hormone treatment after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. radiation therapy radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. there are two types of radiation therapy: - external radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. - internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. the way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. external and internal radiation therapy are used to treat endometrial cancer, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. chemotherapy chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. when chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). when chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). the way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. hormone therapy hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. if tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working. targeted therapy targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. monoclonal antibodies, mtor inhibitors, and signal transduction inhibitors are three types of targeted therapy used to treat endometrial cancer. - monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. these antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. the antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. they may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. bevacizumab is used to treat stage iii, stage iv, and recurrent endometrial cancer. - mtor inhibitors block a protein called mtor, which helps control cell division. mtor inhibitors may keep cancer cells from growing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. everolimus and ridaforalimus are used to treat stage iii, stage iv, and recurrent endometrial cancer. - signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell. blocking these signals may kill cancer cells. metformin is being studied to treat stage iii, stage iv, and recurrent endometrial cancer. new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. for some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. there are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. see the treatment options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. these have been retrieved from nci's listing of clinical trials. follow-up tests may be needed. some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. the results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). these tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups. treatment options by stage stage i and stage ii endometrial cancer low-risk endometrial cancer (grade 1 or grade 2) treatment of low-risk stage i endometrial cancer and stage ii endometrial cancer may include the following: - surgery (total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen may also be removed and viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells. - surgery (total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, with or without removal of lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen) followed by internal radiation therapy. in certain cases, external radiation therapy to the pelvis may be used in place of internal radiation therapy. - radiation therapy alone for patients who cannot have surgery. - a clinical trial of a new chemotherapy regimen. if cancer has spread to the cervix, a radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be done. high-risk endometrial cancer (grade 3) treatment of high-risk stage i endometrial cancer and stage ii endometrial cancer may include the following: - surgery (radical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen may also be removed and viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells. - surgery (radical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) followed by chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy. - a clinical trial of a new chemotherapy regimen. check the list of nci-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with stage i endometrial carcinoma and stage ii endometrial carcinoma. for more specific results, refine the search by using other search features, such as the location of the trial, the type of treatment, or the name of the drug. talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you. general information about clinical trials is available from the nci website. stage iii, stage iv, and recurrent endometrial cancer treatment of stage iii endometrial cancer, stage iv endometrial cancer, and recurrent endometrial cancer may include the following: -

<question>how many people are affected by essential tremor ?<answer>essential tremor is a common disorder, affecting up to 10 million people in the united states. estimates of its prevalence vary widely because several other disorders, as well as other factors such as certain medications, can result in similar tremors. in addition, mild cases are often not brought to medical attention, or may not be detected in clinical exams that do not include the particular circumstances in which an individual's tremor occurs. severe cases are often misdiagnosed as parkinson disease.<end>
<question>how many people are affected by von willebrand disease ?<answer>von willebrand disease is estimated to affect 1 in 100 to 10,000 individuals. because people with mild signs and symptoms may not come to medical attention, it is thought that this condition is underdiagnosed. most researchers agree that von willebrand disease is the most common genetic bleeding disorder.<end>
<question>what are the treatments for osteoarthritis ?<answer>people with osteoarthritis may find many non-drug ways to relieve pain. below are some examples. heat and cold. heat or cold (or a combination of the two) can be useful for joint pain. heat can be applied in a number of different ways -- with warm towels, hot packs, or a warm bath or shower -- to increase blood flow and ease pain and stiffness. in some cases, cold packs (bags of ice or frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel), which reduce inflammation, can relieve pain or numb the sore area. (check with a doctor or physical therapist to find out if heat or cold is the best treatment.) transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (tens). tens is a technique that uses a small electronic device to direct mild electric pulses to nerve endings that lie beneath the skin in the painful area. tens may relieve some arthritis pain. it seems to work by blocking pain messages to the brain and by modifying pain perception. massage. in this pain-relief approach, a massage therapist will lightly stroke and/or knead the painful muscles. this may increase blood flow and bring warmth to a stressed area. however, arthritis-stressed joints are sensitive, so the therapist must be familiar with the problems of the disease. acupuncture. some people have found pain relief using acupuncture, a practice in which fine needles are inserted by a licensed acupuncture therapist at specific points on the skin. scientists think the needles stimulate the release of natural, pain-relieving chemicals produced by the nervous system. a large study supported by the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases (niams) and the national center for complementary and alternative medicine (nccam) revealed that acupuncture relieves pain and improves function in knee osteoarthritis, and it serves as an effective complement to standard care. nutritional supplements, such as glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, have been reported to improve the symptoms of people with osteoarthritis, as have certain vitamins. additional studies have been carried out to further evaluate these claims. it is unknown whether they might change the course of disease. folk remedies include the wearing of copper bracelets, following special diets, and rubbing wd-40 on joints to lubricate them. although these practices may or may not be harmful, no scientific research to date shows that they are helpful in treating osteoarthritis. they can also be expensive, and using them may cause people to delay or even abandon useful medical treatment. for general information about alternative therapies, see the complementary health approaches topic.<end>
<question>what is the outlook for kidney dysplasia ?<answer>the long-term outlook for a child with kidney dysplasia in both kidneys is different from the long-term outlook for a child with one dysplastic kidney. a child with kidney dysplasia in both kidneys - is more likely to develop ckd. - needs close follow-up with a pediatric nephrologista doctor who specializes in caring for children with kidney disease. children who live in areas that dont have a pediatric nephrologist available can see a nephrologist who cares for both children and adults. - may eventually need dialysis or a kidney transplant.<end>
<question>what are the treatments for peripheral arterial disease (p.a.d.) ?<answer>yes. in some people, lifestyle changes are not enough to control p.a.d. surgery and other procedures may be needed. these may include bypass grafting surgery, angioplasty, a stent, or a procedure called atherectomy (ath-eh-rek-to-mee). - your doctor may recommend bypass grafting surgery if blood flow in your limb is blocked or nearly blocked. in this type of surgery, a blood vessel from another part of the body or a man-made tube is used to make a graft. this graft bypasses (goes around) the blocked part of the artery, which allows blood to flow around the blockage. this surgery doesn't cure p.a.d., but it may increase blood flow to the affected limb. your doctor may recommend bypass grafting surgery if blood flow in your limb is blocked or nearly blocked. in this type of surgery, a blood vessel from another part of the body or a man-made tube is used to make a graft. this graft bypasses (goes around) the blocked part of the artery, which allows blood to flow around the blockage. this surgery doesn't cure p.a.d., but it may increase blood flow to the affected limb. - angioplasty is used to restore blood flow through a narrowed or blocked artery. during this procedure, a catheter (thin tube) with a balloon or other device on the end is inserted into a blocked artery. the balloon is inflated, which pushes the plaque outward against the wall of the artery. this widens the artery and restores blood flow. angioplasty is used to restore blood flow through a narrowed or blocked artery. during this procedure, a catheter (thin tube) with a balloon or other device on the end is inserted into a blocked artery. the balloon is inflated, which pushes the plaque outward against the wall of the artery. this widens the artery and restores blood flow. - a stent (a small mesh tube) may be placed in the artery during angioplasty. a stent helps keep the artery open after the procedure is done. some stents are coated with medicine to help prevent blockages in the artery. a stent (a small mesh tube) may be placed in the artery during angioplasty. a stent helps keep the artery open after the procedure is done. some stents are coated with medicine to help prevent blockages in the artery. - a procedure called atherectomy (ath-eh-rek-to-mee) may be used to remove plaque buildup from an artery. during the procedure, a catheter (thin tube) is used to insert a small cutting device into the blocked artery. the device is used to shave or cut off the plaque. the bits of plaque are removed from the body through the catheter or washed away in the bloodstream (if theyre small enough). doctors also can do atherectomy using a special laser that dissolves the blockage. a procedure called atherectomy (ath-eh-rek-to-mee) may be used to remove plaque buildup from an artery. during the procedure, a catheter (thin tube) is used to insert a small cutting device into the blocked artery. the device is used to shave or cut off the plaque. the bits of plaque are removed from the body through the catheter or washed away in the bloodstream (if theyre small enough). doctors also can do atherectomy using a special laser that dissolves the blockage.<end>
<question>how to diagnose dry eye ?<answer>diagnosis of dry eye requires a comprehensive eye evaluation. your eye care professional will ask you about your symptoms, your overall health (conditions for which you are treated, medications that you take), your eye history (use of contact lenses, past refractive or other eye surgery), and aspects of your daily environment (exposure to environmental allergens or occupational hazards). he or she will test your vision, check your eye pressure, examine your eyelids and front eye structures, and if necessary may dilate the pupils to examine the inside of the eye. your eye care professional may order a tearing test to find out if your eyes are producing enough tears to keep them moist. in one type of test, called a schirmers test, the doctor may measure your tear production by placing strips of blotting paper under your lower eyelids, usually done after numbing the eye with anesthetic drops. after a few minutes, the doctor removes the strips and measures the amount of tear production.<end>
<question>what are the treatments for problems with smell ?<answer>depending on the cause of your smell disorder, your doctor may be able to treat your problem or suggest ways to cope with it. if a certain medication is the cause of the disorder, ask your doctor if you could substitute other medications or reduce the dose. your doctor will work with you to get the medicine you need while trying to reduce unwanted side effects. some patients with respiratory infections or allergies regain their sense of smell when the illness or condition is over. often, correcting a general medical problem also can restore the sense of smell. for patients with nasal obstructions, such as polyps, or other inflammatory conditions of the nose or sinuses, medical treatments or surgery can restore the sense of smell. occasionally, the sense of smell returns to normal on its own, without any treatment. your doctor may suggest oral steroid medications such as prednisone, which is usually used for a short period of time, or topical steroid sprays, which can be used for longer periods of time. antibiotics are also used to treat nasal infections. the effectiveness of both steroids and antibiotics depends greatly on the severity and duration of the nasal swelling or infection. often relief is temporary.<end>
<question>what are the genetic changes related to angelman syndrome ?<answer>many of the characteristic features of angelman syndrome result from the loss of function of a gene called ube3a. people normally inherit one copy of the ube3a gene from each parent. both copies of this gene are turned on (active) in many of the body's tissues. in certain areas of the brain, however, only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternal copy) is active. this parent-specific gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. if the maternal copy of the ube3a gene is lost because of a chromosomal change or a gene mutation, a person will have no active copies of the gene in some parts of the brain. several different genetic mechanisms can inactivate or delete the maternal copy of the ube3a gene. most cases of angelman syndrome (about 70 percent) occur when a segment of the maternal chromosome 15 containing this gene is deleted. in other cases (about 11 percent), angelman syndrome is caused by a mutation in the maternal copy of the ube3a gene. in a small percentage of cases, angelman syndrome results when a person inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from his or her father (paternal copies) instead of one copy from each parent. this phenomenon is called paternal uniparental disomy. rarely, angelman syndrome can also be caused by a chromosomal rearrangement called a translocation, or by a mutation or other defect in the region of dna that controls activation of the ube3a gene. these genetic changes can abnormally turn off (inactivate) ube3a or other genes on the maternal copy of chromosome 15. the causes of angelman syndrome are unknown in 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals. changes involving other genes or chromosomes may be responsible for the disorder in these cases. in some people who have angelman syndrome, the loss of a gene called oca2 is associated with light-colored hair and fair skin. the oca2 gene is located on the segment of chromosome 15 that is often deleted in people with this disorder. however, loss of the oca2 gene does not cause the other signs and symptoms of angelman syndrome. the protein produced from this gene helps determine the coloring (pigmentation) of the skin, hair, and eyes.<end>
<question>what are the genetic changes related to moyamoya disease ?<answer>the genetics of moyamoya disease are not well understood. research suggests that the condition can be passed through families, and changes in one gene, rnf213, have been associated with the condition. other genes that have not been identified may be involved in moyamoya disease. it is also likely that other factors (such as infection or inflammation) in combination with genetic factors play a role in the condition's development. the rnf213 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. however, research suggests that the rnf213 protein is involved in the proper development of blood vessels. changes in the rnf213 gene involved in moyamoya disease replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the rnf213 protein. the effect of these changes on the function of the rnf213 protein is unknown, and researchers are unsure how the changes contribute to the narrowing of blood vessels or the characteristic blood vessel growth of moyamoya disease. for unknown reasons, people with moyamoya disease have elevated levels of proteins involved in cell and tissue growth, including the growth of blood vessels (angiogenesis). an excess of these proteins could account for the growth of new blood vessels characteristic of moyamoya disease. it is not clear if changes in the rnf213 gene are involved in the overproduction of these proteins.<end>
<question>what are the genetic changes related to anencephaly ?<answer>anencephaly is a complex condition that is likely caused by the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. some of these factors have been identified, but many remain unknown. changes in dozens of genes in individuals with anencephaly and in their mothers may influence the risk of developing this type of neural tube defect. the best-studied of these genes is mthfr, which provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in processing the vitamin folate (also called vitamin b9). a shortage (deficiency) of this vitamin is an established risk factor for neural tube defects. changes in other genes related to folate processing and genes involved in the development of the neural tube have also been studied as potential risk factors for anencephaly. however, none of these genes appears to play a major role in causing the condition. researchers have also examined environmental factors that could contribute to the risk of anencephaly. as mentioned above, folate deficiency appears to play a significant role. studies have shown that women who take supplements containing folic acid (the synthetic form of folate) before they get pregnant and very early in their pregnancy are significantly less likely to have a baby with a neural tube defect, including anencephaly. other possible maternal risk factors for anencephaly include diabetes mellitus, obesity, exposure to high heat (such as a fever or use of a hot tub or sauna) in early pregnancy, and the use of certain anti-seizure medications during pregnancy. however, it is unclear how these factors may influence the risk of anencephaly.<end>
<question>what are the genetic changes related to fabry disease ?<answer>fabry disease is caused by mutations in the gla gene. this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase a. this enzyme is active in lysosomes, which are structures that serve as recycling centers within cells. alpha-galactosidase a normally breaks down a fatty substance called globotriaosylceramide. mutations in the gla gene alter the structure and function of the enzyme, preventing it from breaking down this substance effectively. as a result, globotriaosylceramide builds up in cells throughout the body, particularly cells lining blood vessels in the skin and cells in the kidneys, heart, and nervous system. the progressive accumulation of this substance damages cells, leading to the varied signs and symptoms of fabry disease. gla gene mutations that result in an absence of alpha-galactosidase a activity lead to the classic, severe form of fabry disease. mutations that decrease but do not eliminate the enzyme's activity usually cause the milder, late-onset forms of fabry disease that affect only the heart or kidneys.<end>
<question>what is (are) surviving cancer ?<answer>for many older adults, intimacy remains an important need. cancer and cancer treatment can have a major impact on intimacy and sexual functions for both men and women. problems are often caused by physical changes, such as erectile dysfunction or incontinence which can occur after prostate surgery. other problems are caused by emotional issues like changes in body image because of scarring or the loss of a breast. loss of interest in or desire for intimacy can occur and be particularly troublesome. often, sexual problems will not get better on their own, so it is important to talk with your doctor. he or she can suggest a treatment depending on the type of problem and its cause. a variety of interventions, such as medications, devices, surgery, exercises to strengthen genital muscles, or counseling can help. learn more about treating problems with intimacy after cancer.<end>
<question>what are the genetic changes related to williams syndrome ?<answer>williams syndrome is caused by the deletion of genetic material from a specific region of chromosome 7. the deleted region includes 26 to 28 genes, and researchers believe that a loss of several of these genes probably contributes to the characteristic features of this disorder. clip2, eln, gtf2i, gtf2ird1, and limk1 are among the genes that are typically deleted in people with williams syndrome. researchers have found that loss of the eln gene is associated with the connective tissue abnormalities and cardiovascular disease (specifically supravalvular aortic stenosis) found in many people with this disease. studies suggest that deletion of clip2, gtf2i, gtf2ird1, limk1, and perhaps other genes may help explain the characteristic difficulties with visual-spatial tasks, unique behavioral characteristics, and other cognitive difficulties seen in people with williams syndrome. loss of the gtf2ird1 gene may also contribute to the distinctive facial features often associated with this condition. researchers believe that the presence or absence of the ncf1 gene on chromosome 7 is related to the risk of developing hypertension in people with williams syndrome. when the ncf1 gene is included in the part of the chromosome that is deleted, affected individuals are less likely to develop hypertension. therefore, the loss of this gene appears to be a protective factor. people with williams syndrome whose ncf1 gene is not deleted have a higher risk of developing hypertension. the relationship between other genes in the deleted region of chromosome 7 and the signs and symptoms of williams syndrome is under investigation or unknown.<end>
<question>what are the genetic changes related to metachromatic leukodystrophy ?<answer>most individuals with metachromatic leukodystrophy have mutations in the arsa gene, which provides instructions for making the enzyme arylsulfatase a. this enzyme is located in cellular structures called lysosomes, which are the cell's recycling centers. within lysosomes, arylsulfatase a helps break down sulfatides. a few individuals with metachromatic leukodystrophy have mutations in the psap gene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein that is broken up (cleaved) into smaller proteins that assist enzymes in breaking down various fats. one of these smaller proteins is called saposin b; this protein works with arylsulfatase a to break down sulfatides. mutations in the arsa or psap genes result in a decreased ability to break down sulfatides, resulting in the accumulation of these substances in cells. excess sulfatides are toxic to the nervous system. the accumulation gradually destroys myelin-producing cells, leading to the impairment of nervous system function that occurs in metachromatic leukodystrophy. in some cases, individuals with very low arylsulfatase a activity show no symptoms of metachromatic leukodystrophy. this condition is called pseudoarylsulfatase deficiency.<end>
<question>what are the treatments for anxiety disorders ?<answer>most insurance plans, including health maintenance organizations (hmos), will cover treatment for anxiety disorders. check with your insurance company and find out. if you dont have insurance, the health and human services division of your county government may offer mental health care at a public mental health center that charges people according to how much they are able to pay. if you are on public assistance, you may be able to get care through your state medicaid plan. to learn about more mental health resources, see help for mental illness, from the national institute of mental health at nih.<end>
<question>how to diagnose primary sclerosing cholangitis ?<answer>blood tests to check levels of liver enzymes are the first step in diagnosing psc. doctors confirm the diagnosis using cholangiography, which provides pictures of the bile ducts. cholangiography can be performed in the following ways: - endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). ercp uses an endoscopea long, flexible, lighted tubethat goes down the mouth, beyond the stomach, and into the duodenum to reach an area in the digestive tract where dye can be injected into the bile ducts. x rays are taken when the dye is injected. ercp also can be used to take a tissue sample or to treat blocked ducts. more information about ercp is provided in the niddk health topic, ercp (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography). - percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. this procedure involves inserting a needle through the skin and placing a thin tube into a duct in the liver. dye is injected through the tube and x rays are taken. - magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (mrcp). mrcp uses magnetic resonance imaging (mri) to obtain pictures of the bile ducts. mri machines use radio waves and magnets to scan internal organs and tissues. mrcp does not involve using x rays or inserting instruments into the body. this safe and painless test is increasingly used for diagnosis. other testing may include ultrasound exams and a liver biopsy. ultrasound uses sound waves to create images of organs inside the body. a biopsy involves removal of a small piece of tissue for examination with a microscope.<end>
<question>what are the genetic changes related to joubert syndrome ?<answer>joubert syndrome and related disorders can be caused by mutations in at least 10 genes. the proteins produced from these genes are known or suspected to play roles in cell structures called cilia. cilia are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells and are involved in chemical signaling. cilia are important for the structure and function of many types of cells, including brain cells (neurons) and certain cells in the kidneys and liver. cilia are also necessary for the perception of sensory input (such as sight, hearing, and smell). mutations in the genes associated with joubert syndrome and related disorders lead to problems with the structure and function of cilia. defects in these cell structures probably disrupt important chemical signaling pathways during development. although researchers believe that defective cilia are responsible for most of the features of these disorders, it remains unclear how they lead to specific developmental abnormalities. mutations in the 10 genes known to be associated with joubert syndrome and related disorders only account for about half of all cases of these conditions. in the remaining cases, the genetic cause is unknown.<end>
<question>what are the genetic changes related to kawasaki disease ?<answer>the causes of kawasaki disease are not well understood. the disorder is generally regarded as being the result of an abnormal immune system activation, but the triggers of this abnormal response are unknown. because cases of the disorder tend to cluster geographically and by season, researchers have suggested that an infection may be involved. however, no infectious agent (such as a virus or bacteria) has been identified. a variation in the itpkc gene has been associated with an increased risk of kawasaki disease. the itpkc gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase c. this enzyme helps limit the activity of immune system cells called t cells. t cells identify foreign substances and defend the body against infection. reducing the activity of t cells when appropriate prevents the overproduction of immune proteins called cytokines that lead to inflammation and which, in excess, cause tissue damage. researchers suggest that the itpkc gene variation may interfere with the body's ability to reduce t cell activity, leading to inflammation that damages blood vessels and results in the signs and symptoms of kawasaki disease. it appears likely that other factors, including changes in other genes, also influence the development of this complex disorder.<end>
<question>how to prevent urinary tract infections in children ?<answer>if a child has a normal urinary tract, parents can help the child avoid utis by encouraging regular trips to the bathroom. the parents should make sure the child gets enough to drink if infrequent urination is a problem. the child should be taught proper cleaning techniques after using the bathroom to keep bacteria from entering the urinary tract. loose-fitting clothes and cotton underwear allow air to dry the area. parents should consult a health care provider about the best ways to treat constipation.<end>
<question>what are the treatments for pituitary tumors ?<answer>generally, treatment depends on the type of tumor, the size of the tumor, whether the tumor has invaded or pressed on surrounding structures, such as the brain and visual pathways, and the individuals age and overall health. three types of treatment are used: surgical removal of the tumor; radiation therapy, in which high-dose x-rays are used to kill the tumor cells; and drug therapy to shrink or destroy the tumor. medications are also sometimes used to block the tumor from overproducing hormones. for some people, removing the tumor will also stop the pituitarys ability to produce a specific hormone. these individuals will have to take synthetic hormones to replace the ones their pituitary gland no longer produces.<end>
<question>what are the treatments for intestinal pseudo-obstruction ?<answer>a health care provider will treat intestinal pseudo-obstruction with nutritional support, medications, and, in some cases, decompression. rarely, a person will need surgery. if an illness, a medication, or both cause intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a health care provider will treat the underlying illness, stop the medication, or do both. nutritional support people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction often need nutritional support to prevent malnutrition and weight loss. enteral nutrition provides liquid food through a feeding tube inserted through the nose into the stomach or placed directly into the stomach or small intestine. a health care provider inserts the feeding tube, sometimes using x ray or endoscopy for guidance, and teaches the person how to care for the tube after returning home. enteral nutrition is sufficient for most people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction. in a severe case, a person may need iv feeding, also called parenteral nutrition, which provides liquid food through a tube placed in a vein. enteral nutrition is possible because the intestinal lining is normal in most people with intestinal pseudo-obstruction. enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition because it has a much lower risk of complications. medications a health care provider prescribes medications to treat the different symptoms and complications of intestinal pseudo-obstruction, such as - antibiotics to treat bacterial infections - pain medication, which should be used sparingly, if at all, because most pain medications delay intestinal transit - medication to make intestinal muscles contract - antinausea medications - antidiarrheal medications - laxatives decompression a person with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction and a greatly enlarged colon who does not respond to medications may need a procedure, called decompression, to remove gas from the colon. a gastroenterologist can perform the procedure in a hospital or an outpatient center. the gastroenterologist may choose to decompress the colon by using colonoscopy. during colonoscopy, the gastroenterologist inserts a flexible tube into the colon through the anus. a health care provider gives the person a light sedative, and possibly pain medication, to relax. if the person requires long-term decompression, the gastroenterologist also can decompress the colon through a surgical opening in the cecum. in this case, the health care provider gives the person local anesthesia. surgery in severe cases of intestinal pseudo-obstruction, a person may need surgery to remove part of the intestine. however, surgery should be performed rarely, if at all, because intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a generalized disorder that typically affects the entire intestine. removing part of the intestine cannot cure the disease. a surgeona doctor who specializes in surgerywill perform the surgery at a hospital; a person will need general anesthesia. a few highly specialized treatment centers offer small intestine transplantation. a health care provider may recommend small intestine transplantation when all other treatments have failed.<end>
<question>what is (are) amyloidosis and kidney disease ?<answer>primary amyloidosis and dialysis-related amyloidosis are the types of amyloidosis that can affect the kidneys. primary amyloidosis of the kidneys the kidneys are the organs most commonly affected by primary amyloidosis. amyloid deposits damage the kidneys and make it harder for them to filter wastes and break down proteins. when the kidneys become too damaged, they may no longer be able to function well enough to maintain health, resulting in kidney failure. kidney failure can lead to problems such as high blood pressure, bone disease, and anemiaa condition in which the body has fewer red blood cells than normal. dialysis-related amyloidosis people who suffer from kidney failure and have been on long-term dialysis may develop dialysis-related amyloidosis. this type of amyloidosis occurs when a certain protein, called beta-2 microglobulin, builds up in the blood because dialysis does not remove it completely. the two types of dialysis are - hemodialysis. hemodialysis uses a special filter called a dialyzer to remove wastes and extra fluid from the blood. - peritoneal dialysis. peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of the abdominal cavitythe space in the body that holds organs such as the stomach, intestines, and liverto filter the blood. dialysis-related amyloidosis is a complication of kidney failure because neither hemodialysis nor peritoneal dialysis effectively filters beta-2 microglobulin from the blood. as a result, elevated amounts of beta-2 microglobulin remain in the blood. dialysis-related amyloidosis is relatively common in people with kidney failure, especially adults older than 60 years of age, who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years.1 more information is provided in the niddk health topics: - treatment methods for kidney failure: hemodialysis - treatment methods for kidney failure: peritoneal dialysis<end>
<question>what is (are) creating a family health history ?<answer>a heritable disease is caused by a mutation, or harmful change, in a gene inherited from a parent. genes are small structures in your body's cells that determine how you look and tell your body how to work. examples of heritable diseases are huntington's disease, sickle cell anemia, and muscular dystrophy. most diseases that run in the family are not strictly genetic. learn basic information about chromosomes. learn basic information about dna.<end>
<question>what causes abdominal adhesions ?<answer>abdominal surgery is the most frequent cause of abdominal adhesions. surgery-related causes include - cuts involving internal organs - handling of internal organs - drying out of internal organs and tissues - contact of internal tissues with foreign materials, such as gauze, surgical gloves, and stitches - blood or blood clots that were not rinsed away during surgery abdominal adhesions can also result from inflammation not related to surgery, including - appendix rupture - radiation treatment - gynecological infections - abdominal infections rarely, abdominal adhesions form without apparent cause.<end>
<question>what causes cystic fibrosis ?<answer>a defect in the cftr gene causes cystic fibrosis (cf). this gene makes a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your body's cells. in people who have cf, the gene makes a protein that doesn't work well. this causes thick, sticky mucus and very salty sweat. research suggests that the cftr protein also affects the body in other ways. this may help explain other symptoms and complications of cf. more than a thousand known defects can affect the cftr gene. the type of defect you or your child has may affect the severity of cf. other genes also may play a role in the severity of the disease. how is cystic fibrosis inherited? every person inherits two cftr genesone from each parent. children who inherit a faulty cftr gene from each parent will have cf. children who inherit one faulty cftr gene and one normal cftr gene are "cf carriers." cf carriers usually have no symptoms of cf and live normal lives. however, they can pass the faulty cftr gene to their children. the image below shows how two parents who are both cf carriers can pass the faulty cftr gene to their children. example of an inheritance pattern for cystic fibrosis<end>
<question>what are the symptoms of diabetic neuropathies: the nerve damage of diabetes ?<answer>symptoms depend on the type of neuropathy and which nerves are affected. some people with nerve damage have no symptoms at all. for others, the first symptom is often numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet. symptoms are often minor at first, and because most nerve damage occurs over several years, mild cases may go unnoticed for a long time. symptoms can involve the sensory, motor, and autonomicor involuntarynervous systems. in some people, mainly those with focal neuropathy, the onset of pain may be sudden and severe. symptoms of nerve damage may include - numbness, tingling, or pain in the toes, feet, legs, hands, arms, and fingers - wasting of the muscles of the feet or hands - indigestion, nausea, or vomiting - diarrhea or constipation - dizziness or faintness due to a drop in blood pressure after standing or sitting up - problems with urination - erectile dysfunction in men or vaginal dryness in women - weakness symptoms that are not due to neuropathy, but often accompany it, include weight loss and depression.<end>
<question>what are the symptoms of charcot-marie-tooth disease ?<answer>what are the signs and symptoms of charcot-marie-tooth disease? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for charcot-marie-tooth disease. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients (when available) abnormality of the pharynx 90% abnormality of the voice 90% decreased nerve conduction velocity 90% emg abnormality 90% gait disturbance 90% hemiplegia/hemiparesis 90% impaired pain sensation 90% incoordination 90% kyphosis 90% laryngomalacia 90% scoliosis 90% skeletal muscle atrophy 90% the human phenotype ontology (hpo) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. sometimes, no information on frequency is available. in these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.<end>
<question>is sotos syndrome inherited ?<answer>how is sotos syndrome inherited? sotos syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. this means that having a mutation in only one of the 2 copies of the responsible gene (the nsd1 gene) is enough to cause signs and symptoms of the condition. 95% of people with sotos syndrome do not inherit the condition from a parent. in these cases, the condition is the result of a new (de novo) mutation that occurred for the first time in the affected person. only about 5% of people with sotos syndrome have an affected parent and inherit the condition from that parent. if a parent of an affected person with an identified nsd1 mutation does not have any features of sotos syndrome, that parent is very unlikely to have a mutation in the gene. this can be confirmed with genetic testing if the mutation has been identified in the child. if a person with sotos syndrome has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutation. however, the specific features and severity can vary from one generation to the next, so it is not possible to predict how a child will be affected.<end>
<question>what is (are) hemophilia ?<answer>espaol hemophilia (heem-o-fill-ee-ah) is a rare bleeding disorder in which the blood doesn't clot normally. if you have hemophilia, you may bleed for a longer time than others after an injury. you also may bleed inside your body (internally), especially in your knees, ankles, and elbows. this bleeding can damage your organs and tissues and may be life threatening. overview hemophilia usually is inherited. "inherited means that the disorder is passed from parents to children through genes. people born with hemophilia have little or no clotting factor. clotting factor is a protein needed for normal blood clotting. there are several types of clotting factors. these proteins work with platelets (plate-lets) to help the blood clot. platelets are small blood cell fragments that form in the bone marrowa sponge-like tissue in the bones. platelets play a major role in blood clotting. when blood vessels are injured, clotting factors help platelets stick together to plug cuts and breaks on the vessels and stop bleeding. the two main types of hemophilia are a and b. if you have hemophilia a, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor viii (8). about 8 out of 10 people who have hemophilia have type a. if you have hemophilia b, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor ix (9). rarely, hemophilia can be acquired. "acquired means you aren't born with the disorder, but you develop it during your lifetime. this can happen if your body forms antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factors in your bloodstream. the antibodies can prevent the clotting factors from working. this article focuses on inherited hemophilia. outlook hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how much clotting factor is in your blood. about 7 out of 10 people who have hemophilia a have the severe form of the disorder. people who don't have hemophilia have a factor viii activity of 100 percent. people who have severe hemophilia a have a factor viii activity of less than 1 percent. hemophilia usually occurs in males (with rare exceptions). about 1 in 5,000 males are born with hemophilia each year.<end>
<question>what are the symptoms of depression ?<answer>common symptoms there are many symptoms associated with depression, and some will vary depending on the individual. however, some of the most common symptoms are listed below. if you have several of these symptoms for more than two weeks, you may have depression. - feeling nervous or emotionally "empty" - feelings of excessive guilt or worthlessness - tiredness or a "slowed down" feeling - restlessness and irritability - feeling like life is not worth living - sleep problems, including trouble getting to sleep, wakefulness in the middle of the night, or sleeping too much - eating more or less than usual, usually with unplanned weight gain or loss - having persistent headaches, stomach-aches or other chronic pain that does not go away when treated - loss of interest in once pleasurable activities, including sex - frequent crying - difficulty focusing, remembering or making decisions - thoughts of death or suicide, or a suicide attempt feeling nervous or emotionally "empty" feelings of excessive guilt or worthlessness tiredness or a "slowed down" feeling restlessness and irritability feeling like life is not worth living sleep problems, including trouble getting to sleep, wakefulness in the middle of the night, or sleeping too much eating more or less than usual, usually with unplanned weight gain or loss having persistent headaches, stomach-aches or other chronic pain that does not go away when treated loss of interest in once pleasurable activities, including sex frequent crying difficulty focusing, remembering or making decisions thoughts of death or suicide, or a suicide attempt is it depression or something else? the first step to getting appropriate treatment is to visit a doctor. certain medications taken for other medical conditions, vitamin b12 deficiency, some viruses, or a thyroid disorder can cause symptoms similar to depression. if an older adult is taking several medications for other conditions and is depressed, seeing a doctor is especially important. a doctor can rule out medications or another medical condition as the cause of the depression by doing a complete physical exam, interview, and lab tests. if these other factors can be ruled out, he or she may refer you to a mental health professional, such as a psychologist, counselor, social worker, or psychiatrist. some doctors called geriatric psychiatrists and clinical geropsychologists are specially trained to treat depression and other mental illnesses in older adults. the doctor or mental health professional will ask about the history of your symptoms, such as when they started, how long they have lasted, their severity, whether they have occurred before, and if so, whether they were treated and how. he or she will then diagnose the depression and work with you to choose the most appropriate treatment.<end>

<question>what causes prostate enlargement: benign prostatic hyperplasia ?<answer>the cause of benign prostatic hyperplasia is not well understood; however, it occurs mainly in older men. benign prostatic hyperplasia does not develop in men whose testicles were removed before puberty. for this reason, some researchers believe factors related to aging and the testicles may cause benign prostatic hyperplasia. throughout their lives, men produce testosterone, a male hormone, and small amounts of estrogen, a female hormone. as men age, the amount of active testosterone in their blood decreases, which leaves a higher proportion of estrogen. scientific studies have suggested that benign prostatic hyperplasia may occur because the higher proportion of estrogen within the prostate increases the activity of substances that promote prostate cell growth. another theory focuses on dihydrotestosterone (dht), a male hormone that plays a role in prostate development and growth. some research has indicated that even with a drop in blood testosterone levels, older men continue to produce and accumulate high levels of dht in the prostate. this accumulation of dht may encourage prostate cells to continue to grow. scientists have noted that men who do not produce dht do not develop benign prostatic hyperplasia.<end>
