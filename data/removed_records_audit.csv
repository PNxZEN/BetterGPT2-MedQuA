staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and in the nose of about 30% of individuals. most of the time, staph does not cause any harm. these infections can look like pimples, boils, or other skin conditions and most are able to be treated. sometimes staph bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause serious infections which can be fatal, including: bacteremia or sepsis when bacteria spread to the bloodstream usually as a result of using catheters or having surgery. pneumonia which predominantly affects people with underlying lung disease including those on mechanical ventilators. endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) which can lead to heart failure. osteomyelitis (bone infection) which can be caused by staph bacteria traveling in the bloodstream or put there by direct contact such as following trauma (puncture wound of foot or intravenous (iv) drug abuse). top of page how do visa and vrsa get their names? staph bacteria are classified as visa or vrsa based on laboratory tests. laboratories perform tests to determine if staph bacteria are resistant to antimicrobial agents that might be used for treatment of infections. for vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents, laboratories determine how much of the agent it requires to inhibit the growth of the organism in a test tube. the result of the test is usually expressed as a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) or the minimum amount of antimicrobial agent that inhibits bacterial growth in the test tube. therefore, staph bacteria are classified as visa if the mic for vancomycin is 4-8µg/ml, and classified as vrsa if the vancomycin mic is ≥16µg/ml. top of page what should a patient do if they suspect they have a staph, mrsa, visa, or vrsa infection?

how vaccines prevent disease,"why are childhood vaccines so important? it is always better to prevent a disease than to treat it after it occurs. diseases that used to be common in this country and around the world, including polio, measles, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), rubella (german measles), mumps, tetanus, rotavirus and haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) can now be prevented by vaccination. thanks to a vaccine, one of the most terrible diseases in history – smallpox – no longer exists outside the laboratory. over the years vaccines have prevented countless cases of disease and saved millions of lives. immunity protects us from disease immunity is the body’s way of preventing disease. children are born with an immune system composed of cells, glands, organs, and fluids located throughout the body. the immune system recognizes germs that enter the body as ""foreign invaders” (called antigens) and produces proteins called antibodies to fight them. the first time a child is infected with a specific antigen (say measles virus), the immune system produces antibodies designed to fight it. this takes time . . . usually the immune system can’t work fast enough to prevent the antigen from causing disease, so the child still gets sick. however, the immune system “remembers” that antigen. if it ever enters the body again, even after many years, the immune system can produce antibodies fast enough to keep it from causing disease a second time. this protection is called immunity. it would be nice if there were a way to give children immunity to a disease without their having to get sick first. in fact there is: vaccines contain the same antigens (or parts of antigens) that cause diseases. for example, measles vaccine contains measles virus. but the antigens in vaccines are either killed, or weakened to the point that they don’t cause disease. however, they are strong enough to make the immune system produce antibodies that lead to immunity. in other words, a vaccine is a safer substitute for a child’s first exposure to a disease. the child gets protection without having to get sick. through vaccination, children can develop immunity without suffering from the actual diseases that vaccines prevent. top of page more facts newborn babies are immune to many diseases because they have antibodies they got from their mothers. however, this immunity goes away during the first year of life. if an unvaccinated child is exposed to a disease germ, the child's body may not be strong enough to fight the disease. before vaccines, many children died from diseases that vaccines now prevent, such as whooping cough, measles, and polio. those same germs exist today, but because babies are protected by vaccines, we don’t see these diseases nearly as often. immunizing individual children also helps to protect the health of our community, especially those people who cannot be immunized (children who are too young to be vaccinated, or those who can’t receive certain vaccines for medical reasons), and the small proportion of people who don’t respond to a particular vaccine. vaccine-preventable diseases have a costly impact, resulting in doctor's visits, hospitalizations, and premature deaths. sick children can also cause parents to lose time from work. related pages why immunize? vaccines: a safe choice parents guide to immunizations for parents: how vaccines prevent diseases top of page images and logos on this website which are trademarked/copyrighted or used with permission of the trademark/copyright or logo holder are not in the public domain. these images and logos have been licensed for or used with permission in the materials provided on this website. the materials in the form presented on this website may be used without seeking further permission. any other use of trademarked/copyrighted images or logos requires permission from the trademark/copyright holder...more this graphic notice means that you are leaving an hhs web site. for more information, please see the exit notification and disclaimer policy.",cdc,

what is (are) causes of diabetes ?,"diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. people with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia. diabetes is a disorder of metabolismthe way the body uses digested food for energy. the digestive tract breaks down carbohydratessugars and starches found in many foodsinto glucose, a form of sugar that enters the bloodstream. with the help of the hormone insulin, cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy. diabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both. insulin is made in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. the pancreas contains clusters of cells called islets. beta cells within the islets make insulin and release it into the blood. if beta cells dont produce enough insulin, or the body doesnt respond to the insulin that is present, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels or a1c levelswhich reflect average blood glucose levelsare higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. in diabetes, the bodys cells are starved of energy despite high blood glucose levels. over time, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, dental disease, and amputations. other complications of diabetes may include increased susceptibility to other diseases, loss of mobility with aging, depression, and pregnancy problems. no one is certain what starts the processes that cause diabetes, but scientists believe genes and environmental factors interact to cause diabetes in most cases. the two main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. a third type, gestational diabetes, develops only during pregnancy. other types of diabetes are caused by defects in specific genes, diseases of the pancreas, certain drugs or chemicals, infections, and other conditions. some people show signs of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",niddk,causes of diabetes
what causes causes of diabetes ?,"type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. in type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells. normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. but in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells. in type 1 diabetes, beta cell destruction may take place over several years, but symptoms of the disease usually develop over a short period of time. type 1 diabetes typically occurs in children and young adults, though it can appear at any age. in the past, type 1 diabetes was called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (lada) may be a slowly developing kind of type 1 diabetes. diagnosis usually occurs after age 30. in lada, as in type 1 diabetes, the bodys immune system destroys the beta cells. at the time of diagnosis, people with lada may still produce their own insulin, but eventually most will need insulin shots or an insulin pump to control blood glucose levels. genetic susceptibility heredity plays an important part in determining who is likely to develop type 1 diabetes. genes are passed down from biological parent to child. genes carry instructions for making proteins that are needed for the bodys cells to function. many genes, as well as interactions among genes, are thought to influence susceptibility to and protection from type 1 diabetes. the key genes may vary in different population groups. variations in genes that affect more than 1 percent of a population group are called gene variants. certain gene variants that carry instructions for making proteins called human leukocyte antigens (hlas) on white blood cells are linked to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. the proteins produced by hla genes help determine whether the immune system recognizes a cell as part of the body or as foreign material. some combinations of hla gene variants predict that a person will be at higher risk for type 1 diabetes, while other combinations are protective or have no effect on risk. while hla genes are the major risk genes for type 1 diabetes, many additional risk genes or gene regions have been found. not only can these genes help identify people at risk for type 1 diabetes, but they also provide important clues to help scientists better understand how the disease develops and identify potential targets for therapy and prevention. genetic testing can show what types of hla genes a person carries and can reveal other genes linked to diabetes. however, most genetic testing is done in a research setting and is not yet available to individuals. scientists are studying how the results of genetic testing can be used to improve type 1 diabetes prevention or treatment. autoimmune destruction of beta cells in type 1 diabetes, white blood cells called t cells attack and destroy beta cells. the process begins well before diabetes symptoms appear and continues after diagnosis. often, type 1 diabetes is not diagnosed until most beta cells have already been destroyed. at this point, a person needs daily insulin treatment to survive. finding ways to modify or stop this autoimmune process and preserve beta cell function is a major focus of current scientific research. recent research suggests insulin itself may be a key trigger of the immune attack on beta cells. the immune systems of people who are susceptible to developing type 1 diabetes respond to insulin as if it were a foreign substance, or antigen. to combat antigens, the body makes proteins called antibodies. antibodies to insulin and other proteins produced by beta cells are found in people with type 1 diabetes. researchers test for these antibodies to help identify people at increased risk of developing the disease. testing the types and levels of antibodies in the blood can help determine whether a person has type 1 diabetes, lada, or another type of diabetes. environmental factors environmental factors, such as foods, viruses, and toxins, may play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes, but the exact nature of their role has not been determined. some theories suggest that environmental factors trigger the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in people with a genetic susceptibility to diabetes. other theories suggest that environmental factors play an ongoing role in diabetes, even after diagnosis. viruses and infections. a virus cannot cause diabetes on its own, but people are sometimes diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during or after a viral infection, suggesting a link between the two. also, the onset of type 1 diabetes occurs more frequently during the winter when viral infections are more common. viruses possibly associated with type 1 diabetes include coxsackievirus b, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, rubella, and mumps. scientists have described several ways these viruses may damage or destroy beta cells or possibly trigger an autoimmune response in susceptible people. for example, anti-islet antibodies have been found in patients with congenital rubella syndrome, and cytomegalovirus has been associated with significant beta cell damage and acute pancreatitisinflammation of the pancreas. scientists are trying to identify a virus that can cause type 1 diabetes so that a vaccine might be developed to prevent the disease. infant feeding practices. some studies have suggested that dietary factors may raise or lower the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. for example, breastfed infants and infants receiving vitamin d supplements may have a reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes, while early exposure to cows milk and cereal proteins may increase risk. more research is needed to clarify how infant nutrition affects the risk for type 1 diabetes. read more in the centers for disease control and preventions (cdcs) publication national diabetes statistics report, 2014 at www.cdc.gov for information about research studies related to type 1 diabetes.",niddk,causes of diabetes
what causes causes of diabetes ?,"type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin. symptoms of type 2 diabetes may develop gradually and can be subtle; some people with type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed for years. type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people who are also overweight or obese. the disease, once rare in youth, is becoming more common in overweight and obese children and adolescents. scientists think genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are the most likely triggers of type 2 diabetes. genetic susceptibility genes play a significant part in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. having certain genes or combinations of genes may increase or decrease a persons risk for developing the disease. the role of genes is suggested by the high rate of type 2 diabetes in families and identical twins and wide variations in diabetes prevalence by ethnicity. type 2 diabetes occurs more frequently in african americans, alaska natives, american indians, hispanics/latinos, and some asian americans, native hawaiians, and pacific islander americans than it does in non-hispanic whites. recent studies have combined genetic data from large numbers of people, accelerating the pace of gene discovery. though scientists have now identified many gene variants that increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, the majority have yet to be discovered. the known genes appear to affect insulin production rather than insulin resistance. researchers are working to identify additional gene variants and to learn how they interact with one another and with environmental factors to cause diabetes. studies have shown that variants of the tcf7l2 gene increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. for people who inherit two copies of the variants, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is about 80 percent higher than for those who do not carry the gene variant.1 however, even in those with the variant, diet and physical activity leading to weight loss help delay diabetes, according to the diabetes prevention program (dpp), a major clinical trial involving people at high risk. genes can also increase the risk of diabetes by increasing a persons tendency to become overweight or obese. one theory, known as the thrifty gene hypothesis, suggests certain genes increase the efficiency of metabolism to extract energy from food and store the energy for later use. this survival trait was advantageous for populations whose food supplies were scarce or unpredictable and could help keep people alive during famine. in modern times, however, when high-calorie foods are plentiful, such a trait can promote obesity and type 2 diabetes. obesity and physical inactivity physical inactivity and obesity are strongly associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. people who are genetically susceptible to type 2 diabetes are more vulnerable when these risk factors are present. an imbalance between caloric intake and physical activity can lead to obesity, which causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. central obesity, in which a person has excess abdominal fat, is a major risk factor not only for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes but also for heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease (cvd). this excess belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause harmful, chronic effects in the body such as damage to blood vessels. the dpp and other studies show that millions of people can lower their risk for type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle changes and losing weight. the dpp proved that people with prediabetesat high risk of developing type 2 diabetescould sharply lower their risk by losing weight through regular physical activity and a diet low in fat and calories. in 2009, a follow-up study of dpp participantsthe diabetes prevention program outcomes study (dppos)showed that the benefits of weight loss lasted for at least 10 years after the original study began.2 read more about the dpp, funded under national institutes of health (nih) clinical trial number nct00004992, and the dppos, funded under nih clinical trial number nct00038727 in diabetes prevention program. insulin resistance insulin resistance is a common condition in people who are overweight or obese, have excess abdominal fat, and are not physically active. muscle, fat, and liver cells stop responding properly to insulin, forcing the pancreas to compensate by producing extra insulin. as long as beta cells are able to produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels stay in the normal range. but when insulin production falters because of beta cell dysfunction, glucose levels rise, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. abnormal glucose production by the liver in some people with diabetes, an abnormal increase in glucose production by the liver also contributes to high blood glucose levels. normally, the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon when blood glucose and insulin levels are low. glucagon stimulates the liver to produce glucose and release it into the bloodstream. but when blood glucose and insulin levels are high after a meal, glucagon levels drop, and the liver stores excess glucose for later, when it is needed. for reasons not completely understood, in many people with diabetes, glucagon levels stay higher than needed. high glucagon levels cause the liver to produce unneeded glucose, which contributes to high blood glucose levels. metformin, the most commonly used drug to treat type 2 diabetes, reduces glucose production by the liver. the roles of insulin and glucagon in normal blood glucose regulation a healthy persons body keeps blood glucose levels in a normal range through several complex mechanisms. insulin and glucagon, two hormones made in the pancreas, help regulate blood glucose levels: - insulin, made by beta cells, lowers elevated blood glucose levels. - glucagon, made by alpha cells, raises low blood glucose levels. - insulin helps muscle, fat, and liver cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream, lowering blood glucose levels. - insulin stimulates the liver and muscle tissue to store excess glucose. the stored form of glucose is called glycogen. - insulin also lowers blood glucose levels by reducing glucose production in the liver. - glucagon signals the liver and muscle tissue to break down glycogen into glucose, which enters the bloodstream and raises blood glucose levels. - if the body needs more glucose, glucagon stimulates the liver to make glucose from amino acids. metabolic syndrome metabolic syndrome, also called insulin resistance syndrome, refers to a group of conditions common in people with insulin resistance, including - higher than normal blood glucose levels - increased waist size due to excess abdominal fat - high blood pressure - abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood cell signaling and regulation cells communicate through a complex network of molecular signaling pathways. for example, on cell surfaces, insulin receptor molecules capture, or bind, insulin molecules circulating in the bloodstream. this interaction between insulin and its receptor prompts the biochemical signals that enable the cells to absorb glucose from the blood and use it for energy. problems in cell signaling systems can set off a chain reaction that leads to diabetes or other diseases. many studies have focused on how insulin signals cells to communicate and regulate action. researchers have identified proteins and pathways that transmit the insulin signal and have mapped interactions between insulin and body tissues, including the way insulin helps the liver control blood glucose levels. researchers have also found that key signals also come from fat cells, which produce substances that cause inflammation and insulin resistance. this work holds the key to combating insulin resistance and diabetes. as scientists learn more about cell signaling systems involved in glucose regulation, they will have more opportunities to develop effective treatments. beta cell dysfunction scientists think beta cell dysfunction is a key contributor to type 2 diabetes. beta cell impairment can cause inadequate or abnormal patterns of insulin release. also, beta cells may be damaged by high blood glucose itself, a condition called glucose toxicity. scientists have not determined the causes of beta cell dysfunction in most cases. single gene defects lead to specific forms of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody). the genes involved regulate insulin production in the beta cells. although these forms of diabetes are rare, they provide clues as to how beta cell function may be affected by key regulatory factors. other gene variants are involved in determining the number and function of beta cells. but these variants account for only a small percentage of type 2 diabetes cases. malnutrition early in life is also being investigated as a cause of beta cell dysfunction. the metabolic environment of the developing fetus may also create a predisposition for diabetes later in life. risk factors for type 2 diabetes people who develop type 2 diabetes are more likely to have the following characteristics: - age 45 or older - overweight or obese - physically inactive - parent or sibling with diabetes - family background that is african american, alaska native, american indian, asian american, hispanic/latino, or pacific islander american - history of giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds - history of gestational diabetes - high blood pressure140/90 or aboveor being treated for high blood pressure - high-density lipoprotein (hdl), or good, cholesterol below 35 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl), or a triglyceride level above 250 mg/dl - polycystic ovary syndrome, also called pcos - prediabetesan a1c level of 5.7 to 6.4 percent; a fasting plasma glucose test result of 100125 mg/dl, called impaired fasting glucose; or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test result of 140199, called impaired glucose tolerance - acanthosis nigricans, a condition associated with insulin resistance, characterized by a dark, velvety rash around the neck or armpits - history of cvd the american

what causes causes of diabetes ?,"insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction hormones produced by the placenta and other pregnancy-related factors contribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. insulin resistance increases the amount of insulin needed to control blood glucose levels. if the pancreas cant produce enough insulin due to beta cell dysfunction, gestational diabetes occurs. as with type 2 diabetes, excess weight is linked to gestational diabetes. overweight or obese women are at particularly high risk for gestational diabetes because they start pregnancy with a higher need for insulin due to insulin resistance. excessive weight gain during pregnancy may also increase risk. family history having a family history of diabetes is also a risk factor for gestational diabetes, suggesting that genes play a role in its development. genetics may also explain why the disorder occurs more frequently in african americans, american indians, and hispanics/latinos. many gene variants or combinations of variants may increase a womans risk for developing gestational diabetes. studies have found several gene variants associated with gestational diabetes, but these variants account for only a small fraction of women with gestational diabetes. future risk of type 2 diabetes because a womans hormones usually return to normal levels soon after giving birth, gestational diabetes disappears in most women after delivery. however, women who have gestational diabetes are more likely to develop gestational diabetes with future pregnancies and develop type 2 diabetes.3 women with gestational diabetes should be tested for persistent diabetes 6 to 12 weeks after delivery and at least every 3 years thereafter. also, exposure to high glucose levels during gestation increases a childs risk for becoming overweight or obese and for developing type 2 diabetes later on. the result may be a cycle of diabetes affecting multiple generations in a family. for both mother and child, maintaining a healthy body weight and being physically active may help prevent type 2 diabetes.",niddk,causes of diabetes
what causes causes of diabetes ?,"other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes. genetic mutations affecting beta cells, insulin, and insulin action some relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. these mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin. the most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (ndm) and mody. ndm occurs in the first 6 months of life. mody is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life. more information about ndm and mody is provided in the niddk health topic, monogenic forms of diabetes. other rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors. other genetic diseases diabetes occurs in people with down syndrome, klinefelter syndrome, and turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population. scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes. the genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes. cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus, which blocks the pancreas. the risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis. hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. if the disorder is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs. damage to or removal of the pancreas pancreatitis, cancer, and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production, thus causing diabetes. if the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells. endocrine diseases endocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones. cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance. cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas, can also cause diabetes. the tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. hyperthyroidism, a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, can also cause elevated blood glucose levels. autoimmune disorders rare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. this kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells, similar to type 1 diabetes. medications and chemical toxins some medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. pentamidine, a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia, can increase the risk of pancreatitis, beta cell damage, and diabetes. also, glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis. many chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals, but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. for example, dioxina contaminant of the herbicide agent orange, used during the vietnam warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. in 2000, based on a report from the institute of medicine, the u.s. department of veterans affairs (va) added diabetes to the list of conditions for which vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. also, a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes. arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes. lipodystrophy lipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body. the condition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",niddk,causes of diabetes

what is (are) causes of diabetes ?,"diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. people with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia. diabetes is a disorder of metabolismthe way the body uses digested food for energy. the digestive tract breaks down carbohydratessugars and starches found in many foodsinto glucose, a form of sugar that enters the bloodstream. with the help of the hormone insulin, cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy. diabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both. insulin is made in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. the pancreas contains clusters of cells called islets. beta cells within the islets make insulin and release it into the blood. if beta cells dont produce enough insulin, or the body doesnt respond to the insulin that is present, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels or a1c levelswhich reflect average blood glucose levelsare higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. in diabetes, the bodys cells are starved of energy despite high blood glucose levels. over time, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, dental disease, and amputations. other complications of diabetes may include increased susceptibility to other diseases, loss of mobility with aging, depression, and pregnancy problems. no one is certain what starts the processes that cause diabetes, but scientists believe genes and environmental factors interact to cause diabetes in most cases. the two main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. a third type, gestational diabetes, develops only during pregnancy. other types of diabetes are caused by defects in specific genes, diseases of the pancreas, certain drugs or chemicals, infections, and other conditions. some people show signs of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",niddk,causes of diabetes
what causes causes of diabetes ?,"type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. in type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells. normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. but in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells. in type 1 diabetes, beta cell destruction may take place over several years, but symptoms of the disease usually develop over a short period of time. type 1 diabetes typically occurs in children and young adults, though it can appear at any age. in the past, type 1 diabetes was called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (lada) may be a slowly developing kind of type 1 diabetes. diagnosis usually occurs after age 30. in lada, as in type 1 diabetes, the bodys immune system destroys the beta cells. at the time of diagnosis, people with lada may still produce their own insulin, but eventually most will need insulin shots or an insulin pump to control blood glucose levels. genetic susceptibility heredity plays an important part in determining who is likely to develop type 1 diabetes. genes are passed down from biological parent to child. genes carry instructions for making proteins that are needed for the bodys cells to function. many genes, as well as interactions among genes, are thought to influence susceptibility to and protection from type 1 diabetes. the key genes may vary in different population groups. variations in genes that affect more than 1 percent of a population group are called gene variants. certain gene variants that carry instructions for making proteins called human leukocyte antigens (hlas) on white blood cells are linked to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. the proteins produced by hla genes help determine whether the immune system recognizes a cell as part of the body or as foreign material. some combinations of hla gene variants predict that a person will be at higher risk for type 1 diabetes, while other combinations are protective or have no effect on risk. while hla genes are the major risk genes for type 1 diabetes, many additional risk genes or gene regions have been found. not only can these genes help identify people at risk for type 1 diabetes, but they also provide important clues to help scientists better understand how the disease develops and identify potential targets for therapy and prevention. genetic testing can show what types of hla genes a person carries and can reveal other genes linked to diabetes. however, most genetic testing is done in a research setting and is not yet available to individuals. scientists are studying how the results of genetic testing can be used to improve type 1 diabetes prevention or treatment. autoimmune destruction of beta cells in type 1 diabetes, white blood cells called t cells attack and destroy beta cells. the process begins well before diabetes symptoms appear and continues after diagnosis. often, type 1 diabetes is not diagnosed until most beta cells have already been destroyed. at this point, a person needs daily insulin treatment to survive. finding ways to modify or stop this autoimmune process and preserve beta cell function is a major focus of current scientific research. recent research suggests insulin itself may be a key trigger of the immune attack on beta cells. the immune systems of people who are susceptible to developing type 1 diabetes respond to insulin as if it were a foreign substance, or antigen. to combat antigens, the body makes proteins called antibodies. antibodies to insulin and other proteins produced by beta cells are found in people with type 1 diabetes. researchers test for these antibodies to help identify people at increased risk of developing the disease. testing the types and levels of antibodies in the blood can help determine whether a person has type 1 diabetes, lada, or another type of diabetes. environmental factors environmental factors, such as foods, viruses, and toxins, may play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes, but the exact nature of their role has not been determined. some theories suggest that environmental factors trigger the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in people with a genetic susceptibility to diabetes. other theories suggest that environmental factors play an ongoing role in diabetes, even after diagnosis. viruses and infections. a virus cannot cause diabetes on its own, but people are sometimes diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during or after a viral infection, suggesting a link between the two. also, the onset of type 1 diabetes occurs more frequently during the winter when viral infections are more common. viruses possibly associated with type 1 diabetes include coxsackievirus b, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, rubella, and mumps. scientists have described several ways these viruses may damage or destroy beta cells or possibly trigger an autoimmune response in susceptible people. for example, anti-islet antibodies have been found in patients with congenital rubella syndrome, and cytomegalovirus has been associated with significant beta cell damage and acute pancreatitisinflammation of the pancreas. scientists are trying to identify a virus that can cause type 1 diabetes so that a vaccine might be developed to prevent the disease. infant feeding practices. some studies have suggested that dietary factors may raise or lower the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. for example, breastfed infants and infants receiving vitamin d supplements may have a reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes, while early exposure to cows milk and cereal proteins may increase risk. more research is needed to clarify how infant nutrition affects the risk for type 1 diabetes. read more in the centers for disease control and preventions (cdcs) publication national diabetes statistics report, 2014 at www.cdc.gov for information about research studies related

overweight or obese. the disease, once rare in youth, is becoming more common in overweight and obese children and adolescents. scientists think genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are the most likely triggers of type 2 diabetes. genetic susceptibility genes play a significant part in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. having certain genes or combinations of genes may increase or decrease a persons risk for developing the disease. the role of genes is suggested by the high rate of type 2 diabetes in families and identical twins and wide variations in diabetes prevalence by ethnicity. type 2 diabetes occurs more frequently in african americans, alaska natives, american indians, hispanics/latinos, and some asian americans, native hawaiians, and pacific islander americans than it does in non-hispanic whites. recent studies have combined genetic data from large numbers of people, accelerating the pace of gene discovery. though scientists have now identified many gene variants that increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, the majority have yet to be discovered. the known genes appear to affect insulin production rather than insulin resistance. researchers are working to identify additional gene variants and to learn how they interact with one another and with environmental factors to cause diabetes. studies have shown that variants of the tcf7l2 gene increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. for people who inherit two copies of the variants, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is about 80 percent higher than for those who do not carry the gene variant.1 however, even in those with the variant, diet and physical activity leading to weight loss help delay diabetes, according to the diabetes prevention program (dpp), a major clinical trial involving people at high risk. genes can also increase the risk of diabetes by increasing a persons tendency to become overweight or obese. one theory, known as the thrifty gene hypothesis, suggests certain genes increase the efficiency of metabolism to extract energy from food and store the energy for later use. this survival trait was advantageous for populations whose food supplies were scarce or unpredictable and could help keep people alive during famine. in modern times, however, when high-calorie foods are plentiful, such a trait can promote obesity and type 2 diabetes. obesity and physical inactivity physical inactivity and obesity are strongly associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. people who are genetically susceptible to type 2 diabetes are more vulnerable when these risk factors are present. an imbalance between caloric intake and physical activity can lead to obesity, which causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. central obesity, in which a person has excess abdominal fat, is a major risk factor not only for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes but also for heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease (cvd). this excess belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause harmful, chronic effects in the body such as damage to blood vessels. the dpp and other studies show that millions of people can lower their risk for type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle changes and losing weight. the dpp proved that people with prediabetesat high risk of developing type 2 diabetescould sharply lower their risk by losing weight through regular physical activity and a diet low in fat and calories. in 2009, a follow-up study of dpp participantsthe diabetes prevention program outcomes study (dppos)showed that the benefits of weight loss lasted for at least 10 years after the original study began.2 read more about the dpp, funded under national institutes of health (nih) clinical trial number nct00004992, and the dppos, funded under nih clinical trial number nct00038727 in diabetes prevention program. insulin resistance insulin resistance is a common condition in people who are overweight or obese, have excess abdominal fat, and are not physically active. muscle, fat, and liver cells stop responding properly to insulin, forcing the pancreas to compensate by producing extra insulin. as long as beta cells are able to produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels stay in the normal range. but when insulin production falters because of beta cell dysfunction, glucose levels rise, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. abnormal glucose production by the liver in some people with diabetes, an abnormal increase in glucose production by the liver also contributes to high blood glucose levels. normally, the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon when blood glucose and insulin levels are low. glucagon stimulates the liver to produce glucose and release it into the bloodstream. but when blood glucose and insulin levels are high after a meal, glucagon levels drop, and the liver stores excess glucose for later, when it is needed. for reasons not completely understood, in many people with diabetes, glucagon levels stay higher than needed. high glucagon levels cause the liver to produce unneeded glucose, which contributes to high blood glucose levels. metformin, the most commonly used drug to treat type 2 diabetes, reduces glucose production by the liver. the roles of insulin and glucagon in normal blood glucose regulation a healthy persons body keeps blood glucose levels in a normal range through several complex mechanisms. insulin and glucagon, two hormones made in the pancreas, help regulate blood glucose levels: - insulin, made by beta cells, lowers elevated blood glucose levels. - glucagon, made by alpha cells, raises low blood glucose levels. - insulin helps muscle, fat, and liver cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream, lowering blood glucose levels. - insulin stimulates the liver and muscle tissue to store excess glucose. the stored form of glucose is called glycogen. - insulin also lowers blood glucose levels by reducing glucose production in the liver. - glucagon signals the liver and muscle tissue to break down glycogen into glucose, which enters the bloodstream and raises blood glucose levels. - if the body needs more glucose, glucagon stimulates the liver to make glucose from amino acids. metabolic syndrome metabolic syndrome, also called insulin resistance syndrome, refers to a group of conditions common in people with insulin resistance, including - higher than normal blood glucose levels - increased waist size due to excess abdominal fat - high blood pressure - abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood cell signaling and regulation cells communicate through a complex network of molecular signaling pathways. for example, on cell surfaces, insulin receptor molecules capture, or bind, insulin molecules circulating in the bloodstream. this interaction between insulin and its receptor prompts the biochemical signals that enable the cells to absorb glucose from the blood and use it for energy. problems in cell signaling systems can set off a chain reaction that leads to diabetes or other diseases. many studies have focused on how insulin signals cells to communicate and regulate action. researchers have identified proteins and pathways that transmit the insulin signal and have mapped interactions between insulin and body tissues, including the way insulin helps the liver control blood glucose levels. researchers have also found that key signals also come from fat cells, which produce substances that cause inflammation and insulin resistance. this work holds the key to combating insulin resistance and diabetes. as scientists learn more about cell signaling systems involved in glucose regulation, they will have more opportunities to develop effective treatments. beta cell dysfunction scientists think beta cell dysfunction is a key contributor to type 2 diabetes. beta cell impairment can cause inadequate or abnormal patterns of insulin release. also, beta cells may be damaged by high blood glucose itself, a condition called glucose toxicity. scientists have not determined the causes of beta cell dysfunction in most cases. single gene defects lead to specific forms of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody). the genes involved regulate insulin production in the beta cells. although these forms of diabetes are rare, they provide clues as to how beta cell function may be affected by key regulatory factors. other gene variants are involved in determining the number and function of beta cells. but these variants account for only a small percentage of type 2 diabetes cases. malnutrition early in life is also being investigated as a cause of beta cell dysfunction. the metabolic environment of the developing fetus may also create a predisposition for diabetes later in life. risk factors for type 2 diabetes people who develop type 2 diabetes are more likely to have the following characteristics: - age 45 or older - overweight or obese - physically inactive - parent or sibling with diabetes - family background that is african american, alaska native, american indian, asian american, hispanic/latino, or pacific islander american - history of giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds - history of gestational diabetes - high blood pressure140/90 or aboveor being treated for high blood pressure - high-density lipoprotein (hdl), or good, cholesterol below 35 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl), or a triglyceride level above 250 mg/dl - polycystic ovary syndrome, also called pcos - prediabetesan a1c level of 5.7 to 6.4 percent; a fasting plasma glucose test result of 100125 mg/dl, called impaired fasting glucose; or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test result of 140199, called impaired glucose tolerance - acanthosis nigricans, a condition associated with insulin resistance, characterized by a dark, velvety rash around the neck or armpits - history of cvd the american diabetes association (ada) recommends that testing to detect prediabetes and type 2 diabetes be considered in adults who are overweight or obese and have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. in adults without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45.",niddk,causes of diabetes
what causes causes of diabetes ?,"insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction hormones produced by the placenta and other pregnancy-related factors contribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. insulin resistance increases the amount of insulin needed to control blood glucose levels. if the pancreas cant produce enough insulin due to beta cell dysfunction, gestational diabetes occurs. as with type 2 diabetes, excess weight is linked to gestational diabetes. overweight or obese women are at particularly high risk for gestational diabetes because they start pregnancy with a higher need for insulin due to insulin resistance. excessive weight gain during pregnancy may also increase risk. family history having a family history of diabetes is also a risk factor for gestational diabetes, suggesting that genes play a role in its development. genetics may also explain why the disorder occurs more frequently in african americans, american indians, and hispanics/latinos. many gene variants or combinations of variants may increase a womans risk for developing gestational diabetes. studies have found several gene variants associated with gestational diabetes, but these variants account for only a small fraction of women with gestational diabetes. future risk of type 2 diabetes because a womans hormones usually return to normal levels soon after giving birth, gestational diabetes disappears in most women after delivery. however, women who have gestational diabetes are more likely to develop gestational diabetes with future pregnancies and develop type 2 diabetes.3 women with gestational diabetes should be tested for persistent diabetes 6 to 12 weeks after delivery and at least every 3 years thereafter. also, exposure to high glucose levels during gestation increases a childs risk for becoming overweight or obese and for developing type 2 diabetes later on. the result may be a cycle of diabetes affecting multiple generations in a family. for both mother and child, maintaining a healthy body weight and being physically active may help prevent type 2 diabetes.",niddk,causes of diabetes
what causes causes of diabetes ?,"other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes. genetic mutations affecting beta cells, insulin, and insulin action some relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. these mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin. the most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (ndm) and mody. ndm occurs in the first 6 months of life. mody is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life. more information about ndm and mody is provided in the niddk health topic, monogenic forms of diabetes. other rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors. other genetic diseases diabetes occurs in people with down syndrome, klinefelter syndrome, and turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population. scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes. the genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes. cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus, which blocks the pancreas. the risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis. hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. if the disorder is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs. damage to or removal of the pancreas pancreatitis, cancer, and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production, thus causing diabetes. if the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells. endocrine diseases endocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones. cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance. cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas, can also cause diabetes. the tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. hyperthyroidism, a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, can also cause elevated blood glucose levels. autoimmune disorders rare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. this kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells, similar to type 1 diabetes. medications and chemical toxins some medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. pentamidine, a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia, can increase the risk of pancreatitis, beta cell damage, and diabetes. also, glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis. many chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals, but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. for example, dioxina contaminant of the herbicide agent orange, used during the vietnam warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. in 2000, based on a report from the institute of medicine, the u.s. department of veterans affairs (va) added diabetes to the list of conditions for which vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. also, a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes. arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes. lipodystrophy lipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body. the condition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",niddk,causes of diabetes

what to do for causes of diabetes ?,"- diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. scientists believe genes and environmental factors interact to cause diabetes in most cases. - people with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia. diabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both. - insulin is a hormone made by beta cells in the pancreas. insulin helps cells throughout the body absorb and use glucose for energy. if the body does not produce enough insulin or cannot use insulin effectively, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body, and the body is starved of energy. - prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels or a1c levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. people with prediabetes can substantially reduce their risk of developing diabetes by losing weight and increasing physical activity. - the two main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. gestational diabetes is a third form of diabetes that develops only during pregnancy. - type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells. in type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells. - type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin. - scientists believe gestational diabetes is caused by the hormonal changes and metabolic demands of pregnancy together with genetic and environmental factors. risk factors for gestational diabetes include being overweight and having a family history of diabetes. - monogenic forms of diabetes are relatively uncommon and are caused by mutations in single genes that limit insulin production, quality, or action in the body. - other types of diabetes are caused by diseases and injuries that damage the pancreas; certain chemical toxins and medications; infections; and other conditions.",niddk,causes of diabetes

how to prevent kidney disease of diabetes ?,"blood pressure medicines scientists have made great progress in developing methods that slow the onset and progression of kidney disease in people with diabetes. drugs used to lower blood pressure can slow the progression of kidney disease significantly. two types of drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (arbs), have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease. many people require two or more drugs to control their blood pressure. in addition to an ace inhibitor or an arb, a diuretic can also be useful. beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other blood pressure drugs may also be needed. an example of an effective ace inhibitor is lisinopril (prinivil, zestril), which doctors commonly prescribe for treating kidney disease of diabetes. the benefits of lisinopril extend beyond its ability to lower blood pressure: it may directly protect the kidneys' glomeruli. ace inhibitors have lowered proteinuria and slowed deterioration even in people with diabetes who did not have high blood pressure. an example of an effective arb is losartan (cozaar), which has also been shown to protect kidney function and lower the risk of cardiovascular events. patients with even mild hypertension or persistent microalbuminuria should consult a health care provider about the use of antihypertensive medicines. moderate-protein diets in people with diabetes, excessive consumption of protein may be harmful. experts recommend that people with kidney disease of diabetes consume the recommended dietary allowance for protein, but avoid high-protein diets. for people with greatly reduced kidney function, a diet containing reduced amounts of protein may help delay the onset of kidney failure. anyone following a reduced-protein diet should work with a dietitian to ensure adequate nutrition. intensive management of blood glucose antihypertensive drugs and low-protein diets can slow ckd. a third treatment, known as intensive management of blood glucose or glycemic control, has shown great promise for people with diabetes, especially for those in the early stages of ckd. the human body normally converts food to glucose, the simple sugar that is the main source of energy for the body's cells. to enter cells, glucose needs the help of insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. when a person does not make enough insulin, or the body does not respond to the insulin that is present, the body cannot process glucose, and it builds up in the bloodstream. high levels of glucose in the blood lead to a diagnosis of diabetes. intensive management of blood glucose is a treatment regimen that aims to keep blood glucose levels close to normal. the regimen includes testing blood glucose frequently, administering insulin throughout the day on the basis of food intake and physical activity, following a diet and activity plan, and consulting a health care team regularly. some people use an insulin pump to supply insulin throughout the day. a number of studies have pointed to the beneficial effects of intensive management of blood glucose. in the diabetes control and complications trial supported by the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases (niddk), researchers found a 50 percent decrease in both development and progression of early diabetic kidney disease in participants who followed an intensive regimen for controlling blood glucose levels. the intensively managed patients had average blood glucose levels of 150 milligrams per deciliterabout 80 milligrams per deciliter lower than the levels observed in the conventionally managed patients. the united kingdom prospective diabetes study, conducted from 1976 to 1997, showed conclusively that, in people with improved blood glucose control, the risk of early kidney disease was reduced by a third. additional studies conducted over the past decades have clearly established that any program resulting in sustained lowering of blood glucose levels will be beneficial to patients in the early stages of ckd.",niddk,kidney disease of diabetes

what is (are) hypoglycemia ?,"hypoglycemia, also called low blood glucose or low blood sugar, occurs when blood glucose drops below normal levels. glucose, an important source of energy for the body, comes from food. carbohydrates are the main dietary source of glucose. rice, potatoes, bread, tortillas, cereal, milk, fruit, and sweets are all carbohydrate-rich foods. after a meal, glucose is absorbed into the bloodstream and carried to the body's cells. insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps the cells use glucose for energy. if a person takes in more glucose than the body needs at the time, the body stores the extra glucose in the liver and muscles in a form called glycogen. the body can use glycogen for energy between meals. extra glucose can also be changed to fat and stored in fat cells. fat can also be used for energy. when blood glucose begins to fall, glucagonanother hormone made by the pancreassignals the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose into the bloodstream. blood glucose will then rise toward a normal level. in some people with diabetes, this glucagon response to hypoglycemia is impaired and other hormones such as epinephrine, also called adrenaline, may raise the blood glucose level. but with diabetes treated with insulin or pills that increase insulin production, glucose levels can't easily return to the normal range. hypoglycemia can happen suddenly. it is usually mild and can be treated quickly and easily by eating or drinking a small amount of glucose-rich food. if left untreated, hypoglycemia can get worse and cause confusion, clumsiness, or fainting. severe hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, coma, and even death. in adults and children older than 10 years, hypoglycemia is uncommon except as a side effect of diabetes treatment. hypoglycemia can also result, however, from other medications or diseases, hormone or enzyme deficiencies, or tumors.",niddk,hypoglycemia

what are the treatments for hypoglycemia ?,"signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia vary from person to person. people with diabetes should get to know their signs and symptoms and describe them to their friends and family so they can help if needed. school staff should be told how to recognize a child's signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and how to treat it. people who experience hypoglycemia several times in a week should call their health care provider. they may need a change in their treatment plan: less medication or a different medication, a new schedule for insulin or medication, a different meal plan, or a new physical activity plan. prompt treatment for hypoglycemia when people think their blood glucose is too low, they should check the blood glucose level of a blood sample using a meter. if the level is below 70 mg/dl, one of these quick-fix foods should be consumed right away to raise blood glucose: - 3 or 4 glucose tablets - 1 serving of glucose gelthe amount equal to 15 grams of carbohydrate - 1/2 cup, or 4 ounces, of any fruit juice - 1/2 cup, or 4 ounces, of a regularnot dietsoft drink - 1 cup, or 8 ounces, of milk - 5 or 6 pieces of hard candy - 1 tablespoon of sugar or honey recommended amounts may be less for small children. the child's doctor can advise about the right amount to give a child. the next step is to recheck blood glucose in 15 minutes to make sure it is 70 mg/dl or above. if it's still too low, another serving of a quick-fix food should be eaten. these steps should be repeated until the blood glucose level is 70 mg/dl or above. if the next meal is an hour or more away, a snack should be eaten once the quick-fix foods have raised the blood glucose level to 70 mg/dl or above. for people who take acarbose (precose) or miglitol (glyset) people who take either of these diabetes medications should know that only pure glucose, also called dextroseavailable in tablet or gel formwill raise their blood glucose level during a low blood glucose episode. other quick-fix foods and drinks won't raise the level quickly enough because acarbose and miglitol slow the digestion of other forms of carbohydrate. help from others for severe hypoglycemia severe hypoglycemiavery low blood glucosecan cause a person to pass out and can even be life threatening. severe hypoglycemia is more likely to occur in people with type 1 diabetes. people should ask a health care provider what to do about severe hypoglycemia. another person can help someone who has passed out by giving an injection of glucagon. glucagon will rapidly bring the blood glucose level back to normal and help the person regain consciousness. a health care provider can prescribe a glucagon emergency kit. family, friends, or coworkersthe people who will be around the person at risk of hypoglycemiacan learn how to give a glucagon injection and when to call 911 or get medical help. physical activity and blood glucose levels physical activity has many benefits for people with diabetes, including lowering blood glucose levels. however, physical activity can make levels too low and can cause hypoglycemia up to 24 hours afterward. a health care provider can advise about checking the blood glucose level before exercise. for those who take insulin or one of the oral medications that increase insulin production, the health care provider may suggest having a snack if the glucose level is below 100 mg/dl or adjusting medication doses before physical activity to help avoid hypoglycemia. a snack can prevent hypoglycemia. the health care provider may suggest extra blood glucose checks, especially after strenuous exercise. hypoglycemia when driving hypoglycemia is particularly dangerous if it happens to someone who is driving. people with hypoglycemia may have trouble concentrating or seeing clearly behind the wheel and may not be able to react quickly to road hazards or to the actions of other drivers. to prevent problems, people at risk for hypoglycemia should check their blood glucose level before driving. during longer trips, they should check their blood glucose level frequently and eat snacks as needed to keep the level at 70 mg/dl or above. if necessary, they should stop for treatment and then make sure their blood glucose level is 70 mg/dl or above before starting to drive again. hypoglycemia unawareness some people with diabetes do not have early warning signs of low blood glucose, a condition called hypoglycemia unawareness. this condition occurs most often in people with type 1 diabetes, but it can also occur in people with type 2 diabetes. people with hypoglycemia unawareness may need to check their blood glucose level more often so they know when hypoglycemia is about to occur. they also may need a change in their medications, meal plan, or physical activity routine. hypoglycemia unawareness develops when frequent episodes of hypoglycemia lead to changes in how the body reacts to low blood glucose levels. the body stops releasing the hormone epinephrine and other stress hormones when blood glucose drops too low. the loss of the body's ability to release stress hormones after repeated episodes of hypoglycemia is called hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure, or haaf. epinephrine causes early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia such as shakiness, sweating, anxiety, and hunger. without the release of epinephrine and the symptoms it causes, a person may not realize that hypoglycemia is occurring and may not take action to treat it. a vicious cycle can occur in which frequent hypoglycemia leads to hypoglycemia unawareness and haaf, which in turn leads to even more severe and dangerous hypoglycemia. studies have shown that preventing hypoglycemia for a period as short as several weeks can sometimes break this cycle and restore awareness of symptoms. health care providers may therefore advise people who have had severe hypoglycemia to aim for higher-than-usual blood glucose targets for short-term periods. being prepared for hypoglycemia people who use insulin or take an oral diabetes medication that can cause low blood glucose should always be prepared to prevent and treat low blood glucose by - learning what can trigger low blood glucose levels - having their blood glucose meter available to test glucose levels; frequent testing may be critical for those with hypoglycemia unawareness, particularly before driving a car or engaging in any hazardous activity - always having several servings of quick-fix foods or drinks handy - wearing a medical identification bracelet or necklace - planning what to do if they develop severe hypoglycemia - telling their family, friends, and coworkers about the symptoms of hypoglycemia and how they can help if needed normal and target

what are the treatments for acromegaly ?,"currently, treatment options include surgical removal of the tumor, medical therapy, and radiation therapy of the pituitary. goals of treatment are to - reduce excess hormone production to normal levels - relieve the pressure that the growing pituitary tumor may be exerting on the surrounding brain areas - preserve normal pituitary function or treat hormone deficiencies - improve the symptoms of acromegaly surgery surgery is the first option recommended for most people with acromegaly, as it is often a rapid and effective treatment. the surgeon reaches the pituitary via an incision through the nose or inside the upper lip and, with special tools, removes the tumor tissue in a procedure called transsphenoidal surgery. this procedure promptly relieves the pressure on the surrounding brain regions and leads to a rapid lowering of gh levels. if the surgery is successful, facial appearance and soft tissue swelling improve within a few days. surgery is most successful in patients with blood gh levels below 45 ng/ml before the operation and with pituitary tumors no larger than 10 millimeters (mm) in diameter. success depends in large part on the skill and experience of the surgeon, as well as the location of the tumor. even with the most experienced neurosurgeon, the chance of a cure is small if the tumor has extended into critical brain structures or into the cavernous sinus where surgery could be risky. the success rate also depends on what level of gh is defined as a cure. the best measure of surgical success is normalization of gh and igf-i levels. the overall rate of remission-control of the disease-after surgery ranges from 55 to 80 percent. (see for more information to locate a board-certified neurosurgeon.) a possible complication of surgery is damage to the surrounding normal pituitary tissue, which requires lifelong use of pituitary hormone replacement. the part of the pituitary that stores antidiuretic hormonea hormone important in water balancemay be temporarily or, rarely, permanently damaged and the patient may require medical therapy. other potential problems include cerebrospinal fluid leaks and, rarely, meningitis. cerebrospinal fluid bathes the brain and can leak from the nose if the incision area doesnt heal well. meningitis is a bacterial or viral infection of the meninges, the outer covering of the brain. even when surgery is successful and hormone levels return to normal, people with acromegaly must be carefully monitored for years for possible recurrence of the disease. more commonly, hormone levels improve, but do not return to normal. additional treatment, usually medications, may be required. medical therapy medical therapy is most often used if surgery does not result in a cure and sometimes to shrink large tumors before surgery. three medication groups are used to treat acromegaly. somatostatin analogs (ssas) are the first medication group used to treat acromegaly. they shut off gh production and are effective in lowering gh and igf-i levels in 50 to 70 percent of patients. ssas also reduce tumor size in around 0 to 50 percent of patients but only to a modest degree. several studies have shown that ssas are safe and effective for long-term treatment and in treating patients with acromegaly caused by nonpituitary tumors. long-acting ssas are given by intramuscular injection once a month. digestive problems-such as loose stools, nausea, and gas-are a side effect in about half of people taking ssas. however, the effects are usually temporary and rarely severe. about 10 to 20 percent of patients develop gallstones, but the gallstones do not usually cause symptoms. in rare cases, treatment can result in elevated blood glucose levels. more commonly, ssas reduce the need for insulin and improve blood glucose control in some people with acromegaly who already have diabetes. the second medication group is the gh receptor antagonists (ghras), which interfere with the action of gh. they normalize igf-i levels in more than 90 percent of patients. they do not, however, lower gh levels. given once a day through injection, ghras are usually well-tolerated by patients. the long-term effects of these drugs on tumor growth are still under study. side effects can include headaches, fatigue, and abnormal liver function. dopamine agonists make up the third medication group. these drugs are not as effective as the other medications at lowering gh or igf-i levels, and they normalize igf-i levels in only a minority of patients. dopamine agonists are sometimes effective in patients who have mild degrees of excess gh and have both acromegaly and hyperprolactinemiatoo much of the hormone prolactin. dopamine agonists can be used in combination with ssas. side effects can include nausea, headache, and lightheadedness. agonist: a drug that binds to a receptor of a cell and triggers a response by the cell, mimicking the action of a naturally occurring substance. antagonist: a chemical that acts within the body to reduce the physiological activity of another chemical substance or hormone. radiation therapy radiation therapy is usually reserved for people who have some tumor remaining after surgery and do not respond to medications. because radiation leads to a slow lowering of gh and igf-i levels, these patients often also receive medication to lower hormone levels. the full effect of this therapy may not occur for many years. the two types of radiation delivery are conventional and stereotactic. conventional radiation delivery targets the tumor with external beams but can damage surrounding tissue. the treatment delivers small doses of radiation multiple times over 4 to 6 weeks, giving normal tissue time to heal between treatments. stereotactic delivery allows precise targeting of a high-dose beam of radiation at the tumor from varying angles. the patient must wear a rigid head frame to keep the head still. the types of stereotactic radiation delivery currently available are proton beam, linear accelerator (linac), and gamma knife. with stereotactic delivery, the tumor must be at least 5 mm from the optic chiasm to prevent radiation damage. this treatment can sometimes be done in a single session, reducing the risk of damage to surrounding tissue. all forms of radiation therapy cause a gradual decline in production of other pituitary hormones over time, resulting in the need for hormone replacement in most patients. radiation also can impair a patients fertility. vision loss and brain injury are rare complications. rarely, secondary tumors can develop many years later in areas that were in the path of the radiation beam.",niddk,acromegaly

what is (are) glomerular diseases ?,"the two kidneys are bean-shaped organs located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. everyday, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. blood enters the kidneys through arteries that branch inside the kidneys into tiny clusters of looping blood vessels. each cluster is called a glomerulus, which comes from the greek word meaning filter. the plural form of the word is glomeruli. there are approximately 1 million glomeruli, or filters, in each kidney. the glomerulus is attached to the opening of a small fluid-collecting tube called a tubule. blood is filtered in the glomerulus, and extra fluid and wastes pass into the tubule and become urine. eventually, the urine drains from the kidneys into the bladder through larger tubes called ureters. each glomerulus-and-tubule unit is called a nephron. each kidney is composed of about 1 million nephrons. in healthy nephrons, the glomerular membrane that separates the blood vessel from the tubule allows waste products and extra water to pass into the tubule while keeping blood cells and protein in the bloodstream.",niddk,glomerular diseases

how to diagnose glomerular diseases ?,"patients with glomerular disease have significant amounts of protein in the urine, which may be referred to as ""nephrotic range"" if levels are very high. red blood cells in the urine are a frequent finding as well, particularly in some forms of glomerular disease. urinalysis provides information about kidney damage by indicating levels of protein and red blood cells in the urine. blood tests measure the levels of waste products such as creatinine and urea nitrogen to determine whether the filtering capacity of the kidneys is impaired. if these lab tests indicate kidney damage, the doctor may recommend ultrasound or an x ray to see whether the shape or size of the kidneys is abnormal. these tests are called renal imaging. but since glomerular disease causes problems at the cellular level, the doctor will probably also recommend a kidney biopsya procedure in which a needle is used to extract small pieces of tissue for examination with different types of microscopes, each of which shows a different aspect of the tissue. a biopsy may be helpful in confirming glomerular disease and identifying the cause.",niddk,glomerular diseases

what causes glomerular diseases ?,"a number of different diseases can result in glomerular disease. it may be the direct result of an infection or a drug toxic to the kidneys, or it may result from a disease that affects the entire body, like diabetes or lupus. many different kinds of diseases can cause swelling or scarring of the nephron or glomerulus. sometimes glomerular disease is idiopathic, meaning that it occurs without an apparent associated disease. the categories presented below can overlap: that is, a disease might belong to two or more of the categories. for example, diabetic nephropathy is a form of glomerular disease that can be placed in two categories: systemic diseases, since diabetes itself is a systemic disease, and sclerotic diseases, because the specific damage done to the kidneys is associated with scarring. autoimmune diseases when the body's immune system functions properly, it creates protein-like substances called antibodies and immunoglobulins to protect the body against invading organisms. in an autoimmune disease, the immune system creates autoantibodies, which are antibodies or immunoglobulins that attack the body itself. autoimmune diseases may be systemic and affect many parts of the body, or they may affect only specific organs or regions. systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) affects many parts of the body: primarily the skin and joints, but also the kidneys. because women are more likely to develop sle than men, some researchers believe that a sex-linked genetic factor may play a part in making a person susceptible, although viral infection has also been implicated as a triggering factor. lupus nephritis is the name given to the kidney disease caused by sle, and it occurs when autoantibodies form or are deposited in the glomeruli, causing inflammation. ultimately, the inflammation may create scars that keep the kidneys from functioning properly. conventional treatment for lupus nephritis includes a combination of two drugs, cyclophosphamide, a cytotoxic agent that suppresses the immune system, and prednisolone, a corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation. a newer immunosuppressant, mychophenolate mofetil (mmf), has been used instead of cyclophosphamide. preliminary studies indicate that mmf may be as effective as cyclophosphamide and has milder side effects. goodpasture's syndrome involves an autoantibody that specifically targets the kidneys and the lungs. often, the first indication that patients have the autoantibody is when they cough up blood. but lung damage in goodpasture's syndrome is usually superficial compared with progressive and permanent damage to the kidneys. goodpasture's syndrome is a rare condition that affects mostly young men but also occurs in women, children, and older adults. treatments include immunosuppressive drugs and a blood-cleaning therapy called plasmapheresis that removes the autoantibodies. iga nephropathy is a form of glomerular disease that results when immunoglobulin a (iga) forms deposits in the glomeruli, where it creates inflammation. iga nephropathy was not recognized as a cause of glomerular disease until the late 1960s, when sophisticated biopsy techniques were developed that could identify iga deposits in kidney tissue. the most common symptom of iga nephropathy is blood in the urine, but it is often a silent disease that may go undetected for many years. the silent nature of the disease makes it difficult to determine how many people are in the early stages of iga nephropathy, when specific medical tests are the only way to detect it. this disease is estimated to be the most common cause of primary glomerulonephritisthat is, glomerular disease not caused by a systemic disease like lupus or diabetes mellitus. it appears to affect men more than women. although iga nephropathy is found in all age groups, young people rarely display signs of kidney failure because the disease usually takes several years to progress to the stage where it causes detectable complications. no treatment is recommended for early or mild cases of iga nephropathy when the patient has normal blood pressure and less than 1 gram of protein in a 24-hour urine output. when proteinuria exceeds 1 gram/day, treatment is aimed at protecting kidney function by reducing proteinuria and controlling blood pressure. blood pressure medicinesangiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (ace inhibitors) or angiotensin receptor blockers (arbs)that block a hormone called angiotensin are most effective at achieving those two goals simultaneously. hereditary nephritisalport syndrome the primary indicator of alport syndrome is a family history of chronic glomerular disease, although it may also involve hearing or vision impairment. this syndrome affects both men and women, but men are more likely to experience chronic kidney disease and sensory loss. men with alport syndrome usually first show evidence of renal insufficiency while in their twenties and reach total kidney failure by age 40. women rarely have significant renal impairment, and hearing loss may be so slight that it can be detected only through testing with special equipment. usually men can pass the disease only to their daughters. women can transmit the disease to either their sons or their daughters. treatment focuses on controlling blood pressure to maintain kidney function. infection-related glomerular disease glomerular disease sometimes develops rapidly after an infection in other parts of the body. acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (psgn) can occur after an episode of strep throat or, in rare cases, impetigo (a skin infection). the streptococcus bacteria do not attack the kidney directly, but an infection may stimulate the immune system to overproduce antibodies, which are circulated in the blood and finally deposited in the glomeruli, causing damage. psgn can bring on sudden symptoms of swelling (edema), reduced urine output (oliguria), and blood in the urine (hematuria). tests will show large amounts of protein in the urine and elevated levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen in the blood, thus indicating reduced kidney function. high blood pressure frequently accompanies reduced kidney function in this disease. psgn is most common in children between the ages of 3 and 7, although it can strike at any age, and it most often affects boys. it lasts only a brief time and usually allows the kidneys to recover. in a few cases, however, kidney damage may be permanent, requiring dialysis or transplantation to replace renal function. bacterial endocarditis, infection of the tissues inside the heart, is also associated with subsequent glomerular disease. researchers are not sure whether the renal lesions that form after a heart infection are caused entirely by the immune response or whether some other disease mechanism contributes to kidney damage. treating the heart infection is the most effective way of minimizing kidney damage. endocarditis sometimes produces chronic kidney disease (ckd). hiv, the virus that leads to aids, can also cause glomerular disease. between 5 and 10 percent of people with hiv experience kidney failure, even before developing full-blown aids. hiv-associated nephropathy usually begins with heavy proteinuria and progresses rapidly (within a year of detection) to total kidney failure. researchers are looking for therapies that can slow down or reverse this rapid deterioration of renal function, but some possible solutions involving immunosuppression are risky because of the patients' already compromised immune system. sclerotic diseases glomerulosclerosis is scarring (sclerosis) of the glomeruli. in several sclerotic conditions, a systemic disease like lupus or diabetes is responsible. glomerulosclerosis is caused by the activation of glomerular cells to produce scar material. this may be stimulated by molecules called growth factors, which may be made by glomerular cells themselves or may be brought to the glomerulus by the circulating blood that enters the glomerular filter. diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of glomerular disease and of total kidney failure in the united states. kidney disease is one of several problems caused by elevated levels of blood glucose, the central feature of diabetes. in addition to scarring the kidney, elevated glucose levels appear to increase the speed of blood flow into the kidney, putting a strain on the filtering glomeruli and raising blood pressure. diabetic nephropathy usually takes many years to develop. people with diabetes can slow down damage to their kidneys by controlling their blood glucose through healthy eating with moderate protein intake, physical activity, and medications. people with diabetes should also be careful to keep their blood pressure at a level below 140/90 mm hg, if possible. blood pressure medications called ace inhibitors and arbs are particularly effective at minimizing kidney damage and are now frequently prescribed to control blood pressure in patients with diabetes and in patients with many forms of kidney disease. focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (fsgs) describes scarring in scattered regions of the kidney, typically limited to one part of the glomerulus and to a minority of glomeruli in the affected region. fsgs may result from a systemic disorder or it may develop as an idiopathic kidney disease, without a known cause. proteinuria is the most common symptom of fsgs, but, since proteinuria is associated with several other kidney conditions, the doctor cannot diagnose fsgs on the basis of proteinuria alone. biopsy may confirm the presence of glomerular scarring if the tissue is taken from the affected section of the kidney. but finding the affected section is a matter of chance, especially early in the disease process, when lesions may be scattered. confirming a diagnosis of fsgs may require repeat kidney biopsies. arriving at a diagnosis of idiopathic fsgs requires the identification of focal scarring and the elimination of possible systemic causes such as diabetes or an immune response to infection. since idiopathic fsgs is, by definition, of unknown cause, it is difficult to treat. no universal remedy has been found, and most patients with fsgs progress to total kidney failure over 5 to 20 years. some patients with an aggressive form of fsgs reach total kidney failure in 2 to 3 years. treatments involving steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs appear to help some patients by decreasing proteinuria and improving kidney function. but these treatments are beneficial to only a minority of those in whom they are tried, and some patients experience even poorer kidney function as a result. ace inhibitors and arbs may also be used in fsgs to decrease proteinuria. treatment should focus on controlling blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels, factors that may contribute to kidney scarring. other glomerular diseases membranous nephropathy, also called membranous glomerulopathy, is the second most common cause of the nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria, edema, high cholesterol) in u.s. adults after diabetic nephropathy. diagnosis of membranous nephropathy requires a kidney biopsy, which reveals unusual deposits of immunoglobulin g and complement c3, substances created by the body's immune system. fully 75 percent of cases are idiopathic, which means that the cause of the disease is unknown. the remaining 25 percent of cases are the result of other diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus, hepatitis b or c infection, or some forms of cancer. drug therapies involving penicillamine, gold, or captopril have also been associated with membranous nephropathy. about 20 to 40 percent of patients with membranous nephropathy progress, usually over decades, to total kidney failure, but most patients experience either complete remission or continued symptoms without progressive kidney failure. doctors disagree about how aggressively to treat this condition, since about 20 percent of patients recover without treatment. ace inhibitors and arbs are generally used to reduce proteinuria. additional medication to control high blood pressure and edema is frequently required. some patients benefit from steroids, but this treatment does not work for everyone. additional immunosuppressive medications are helpful for some patients with progressive disease. minimal change disease (mcd) is the diagnosis given when a patient has the nephrotic syndrome and the kidney biopsy reveals little or no change to the structure of glomeruli or surrounding tissues when examined by a light microscope. tiny drops of a fatty substance called a lipid may be present, but no scarring has taken place within the kidney. mcd may occur at any age, but it is most common in childhood. a small percentage of patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome do not respond to steroid therapy. for these patients, the doctor may recommend a low-sodium diet and prescribe a diuretic to control edema. the doctor may recommend the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce proteinuria. ace inhibitors and arbs have also been used to reduce proteinuria in patients with steroid-resistant mcd. these patients may respond to larger doses of steroids, more prolonged use of steroids, or steroids in combination with immunosuppressant drugs, such as chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine.",niddk,glomerular diseases

fsgs may result from a systemic disorder or it may develop as an idiopathic kidney disease, without a known cause. proteinuria is the most common symptom of fsgs, but, since proteinuria is associated with several other kidney conditions, the doctor cannot diagnose fsgs on the basis of proteinuria alone. biopsy may confirm the presence of glomerular scarring if the tissue is taken from the affected section of the kidney. but finding the affected section is a matter of chance, especially early in the disease process, when lesions may be scattered. confirming a diagnosis of fsgs may require repeat kidney biopsies. arriving at a diagnosis of idiopathic fsgs requires the identification of focal scarring and the elimination of possible systemic causes such as diabetes or an immune response to infection. since idiopathic fsgs is, by definition, of unknown cause, it is difficult to treat. no universal remedy has been found, and most patients with fsgs progress to total kidney failure over 5 to 20 years. some patients with an aggressive form of fsgs reach total kidney failure in 2 to 3 years. treatments involving steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs appear to help some patients by decreasing proteinuria and improving kidney function. but these treatments are beneficial to only a minority of those in whom they are tried, and some patients experience even poorer kidney function as a result. ace inhibitors and arbs may also be used in fsgs to decrease proteinuria. treatment should focus on controlling blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels, factors that may contribute to kidney scarring. other glomerular diseases membranous nephropathy, also called membranous glomerulopathy, is the second most common cause of the nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria, edema, high cholesterol) in u.s. adults after diabetic nephropathy. diagnosis of membranous nephropathy requires a kidney biopsy, which reveals unusual deposits of immunoglobulin g and complement c3, substances created by the body's immune system. fully 75 percent of cases are idiopathic, which means that the cause of the disease is unknown. the remaining 25 percent of cases are the result of other diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus, hepatitis b or c infection, or some forms of cancer. drug therapies involving penicillamine, gold, or captopril have also been associated with membranous nephropathy. about 20 to 40 percent of patients with membranous nephropathy progress, usually over decades, to total kidney failure, but most patients experience either complete remission or continued symptoms without progressive kidney failure. doctors disagree about how aggressively to treat this condition, since about 20 percent of patients recover without treatment. ace inhibitors and arbs are generally used to reduce proteinuria. additional medication to control high blood pressure and edema is frequently required. some patients benefit from steroids, but this treatment does not work for everyone. additional immunosuppressive medications are helpful for some patients with progressive disease. minimal change disease (mcd) is the diagnosis given when a patient has the nephrotic syndrome and the kidney biopsy reveals little or no change to the structure of glomeruli or surrounding tissues when examined by a light microscope. tiny drops of a fatty substance called a lipid may be present, but no scarring has taken place within the kidney. mcd may occur at any age, but it is most common in childhood. a small percentage of patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome do not respond to steroid therapy. for these patients, the doctor may recommend a low-sodium diet and prescribe a diuretic to control edema. the doctor may recommend the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce proteinuria. ace inhibitors and arbs have also been used to reduce proteinuria in patients with steroid-resistant mcd. these patients may respond to larger doses of steroids, more prolonged use of steroids, or steroids in combination with immunosuppressant drugs, such as chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine.",niddk,glomerular diseases

what is (are) causes of diabetes ?,"diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. people with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia. diabetes is a disorder of metabolismthe way the body uses digested food for energy. the digestive tract breaks down carbohydratessugars and starches found in many foodsinto glucose, a form of sugar that enters the bloodstream. with the help of the hormone insulin, cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy. diabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both. insulin is made in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. the pancreas contains clusters of cells called islets. beta cells within the islets make insulin and release it into the blood. if beta cells dont produce enough insulin, or the body doesnt respond to the insulin that is present, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels or a1c levelswhich reflect average blood glucose levelsare higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. in diabetes, the bodys cells are starved of energy despite high blood glucose levels. over time, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, dental disease, and amputations. other complications of diabetes may include increased susceptibility to other diseases, loss of mobility with aging, depression, and pregnancy problems. no one is certain what starts the processes that cause diabetes, but scientists believe genes and environmental factors interact to cause diabetes in most cases. the two main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. a third type, gestational diabetes, develops only during pregnancy. other types of diabetes are caused by defects in specific genes, diseases of the pancreas, certain drugs or chemicals, infections, and other conditions. some people show signs of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",niddk,causes of diabetes
what causes causes of diabetes ?,"type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. in type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells. normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. but in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells. in type 1 diabetes, beta cell destruction may take place over several years, but symptoms of the disease usually develop over a short period of time. type 1 diabetes typically occurs in children and young adults, though it can appear at any age. in the past, type 1 diabetes was called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (lada) may be a slowly developing kind of type 1 diabetes. diagnosis usually occurs after age 30. in lada, as in type 1 diabetes, the bodys immune system destroys the beta cells. at the time of diagnosis, people with lada may still produce their own insulin, but eventually most will need insulin shots or an insulin pump to control blood glucose levels. genetic susceptibility heredity plays an important part in determining who is likely to develop type 1 diabetes. genes are passed down from biological parent to child. genes carry instructions for making proteins that are needed for the bodys cells to function. many genes, as well as interactions among genes, are thought to influence susceptibility to and protection from type 1 diabetes. the key genes may vary in different population groups. variations in genes that affect more than 1 percent of a population group are called gene variants. certain gene variants that carry instructions for making proteins called human leukocyte antigens (hlas) on white blood cells are linked to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. the proteins produced by hla genes help determine whether the immune system recognizes a cell as part of the body or as foreign material. some combinations of hla gene variants predict that a person will be at higher risk for type 1 diabetes, while other combinations are protective or have no effect on risk. while hla genes are the major risk genes for type 1 diabetes, many additional risk genes or gene regions have been found. not only can these genes help identify people at risk for type 1 diabetes, but they also provide important clues to help scientists better understand how the disease develops and identify potential targets for therapy and prevention. genetic testing can show what types of hla genes a person carries and can reveal other genes linked to diabetes. however, most genetic testing is done in a research setting and is not yet available to individuals. scientists are studying how the results of genetic testing can be used to improve type 1 diabetes prevention or treatment. autoimmune destruction of beta cells in type 1 diabetes, white blood cells called t cells attack and destroy beta cells. the process begins well before diabetes symptoms appear and continues after diagnosis. often, type 1 diabetes is not diagnosed until most beta cells have already been destroyed. at this point, a person needs daily insulin treatment to survive. finding ways to modify or stop this autoimmune process and preserve beta cell function is a major focus of current scientific research. recent research suggests insulin itself may be a key trigger of the immune attack on beta cells. the immune systems of people who are susceptible to developing type 1 diabetes respond to insulin as if it were a foreign substance, or antigen. to combat antigens, the body makes proteins called antibodies. antibodies to insulin and other proteins produced by beta cells are found in people with type 1 diabetes. researchers test for these antibodies to help identify people at increased risk of developing the disease. testing the types and levels of antibodies in the blood can help determine whether a person has type 1 diabetes, lada, or another type of diabetes. environmental factors environmental factors, such as foods, viruses, and toxins, may play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes, but the exact nature of their role has not been determined. some theories suggest that environmental factors trigger the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in people with a genetic susceptibility to diabetes. other theories suggest that environmental factors play an ongoing role in diabetes, even after diagnosis. viruses and infections. a virus cannot cause diabetes on its own, but people are sometimes diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during or after a viral infection, suggesting a link between the two. also, the onset of type 1 diabetes occurs more frequently during the winter when viral infections are more common. viruses possibly associated with type 1 diabetes include coxsackievirus b, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, rubella, and mumps. scientists have described several ways these viruses may damage or destroy beta cells or possibly trigger an autoimmune response in susceptible people. for example, anti-islet antibodies have been found in patients with congenital rubella syndrome, and cytomegalovirus has been associated with significant beta cell damage and acute pancreatitisinflammation of the pancreas. scientists are trying to identify a virus that can cause type 1 diabetes so that a vaccine might be developed to prevent the disease. infant feeding practices. some studies have suggested that dietary factors may raise or lower the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. for example, breastfed infants and infants receiving vitamin d supplements may have a reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes, while early exposure to cows milk and cereal proteins may increase risk. more research is needed to clarify how infant nutrition affects the risk for type 1 diabetes. read more in the centers for disease control and preventions (cdcs) publication national diabetes statistics report, 2014 at www.cdc.gov for information about research studies related

what causes causes of diabetes ?,"type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin. symptoms of type 2 diabetes may develop gradually and can be subtle; some people with type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed for years. type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people who are also overweight or obese. the disease, once rare in youth, is becoming more common in overweight and obese children and adolescents. scientists think genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are the most likely triggers of type 2 diabetes. genetic susceptibility genes play a significant part in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. having certain genes or combinations of genes may increase or decrease a persons risk for developing the disease. the role of genes is suggested by the high rate of type 2 diabetes in families and identical twins and wide variations in diabetes prevalence by ethnicity. type 2 diabetes occurs more frequently in african americans, alaska natives, american indians, hispanics/latinos, and some asian americans, native hawaiians, and pacific islander americans than it does in non-hispanic whites. recent studies have combined genetic data from large numbers of people, accelerating the pace of gene discovery. though scientists have now identified many gene variants that increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, the majority have yet to be discovered. the known genes appear to affect insulin production rather than insulin resistance. researchers are working to identify additional gene variants and to learn how they interact with one another and with environmental factors to cause diabetes. studies have shown that variants of the tcf7l2 gene increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. for people who inherit two copies of the variants, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is about 80 percent higher than for those who do not carry the gene variant.1 however, even in those with the variant, diet and physical activity leading to weight loss help delay diabetes, according to the diabetes prevention program (dpp), a major clinical trial involving people at high risk. genes can also increase the risk of diabetes by increasing a persons tendency to become overweight or obese. one theory, known as the thrifty gene hypothesis, suggests certain genes increase the efficiency of metabolism to extract energy from food and store the energy for later use. this survival trait was advantageous for populations whose food supplies were scarce or unpredictable and could help keep people alive during famine. in modern times, however, when high-calorie foods are plentiful, such a trait can promote obesity and type 2 diabetes. obesity and physical inactivity physical inactivity and obesity are strongly associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. people who are genetically susceptible to type 2 diabetes are more vulnerable when these risk factors are present. an imbalance between caloric intake and physical activity can lead to obesity, which causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. central obesity, in which a person has excess abdominal fat, is a major risk factor not only for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes but also for heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease (cvd). this excess belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause harmful, chronic effects in the body such as damage to blood vessels. the dpp and other studies show that millions of people can lower their risk for type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle changes and losing weight. the dpp proved that people with prediabetesat high risk of developing type 2 diabetescould sharply lower their risk by losing weight through regular physical activity and a diet low in fat and calories. in 2009, a follow-up study of dpp participantsthe diabetes prevention program outcomes study (dppos)showed that the benefits of weight loss lasted for at least 10 years after the original study began.2 read more about the dpp, funded under national institutes of health (nih) clinical trial number nct00004992, and the dppos, funded under nih clinical trial number nct00038727 in diabetes prevention program. insulin resistance insulin resistance is a common condition in people who are overweight or obese, have excess abdominal fat, and are not physically active. muscle, fat, and liver cells stop responding properly to insulin, forcing the pancreas to compensate by producing extra insulin. as long as beta cells are able to produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels stay in the normal range. but when insulin production falters because of beta cell dysfunction, glucose levels rise, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. abnormal glucose production by the liver in some people with diabetes, an abnormal increase in glucose production by the liver also contributes to high blood glucose levels. normally, the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon when blood glucose and insulin levels are low. glucagon stimulates the liver to produce glucose and release it into the bloodstream. but when blood glucose and insulin levels are high after a meal, glucagon levels drop, and the liver stores excess glucose for later, when it is needed. for reasons not completely understood, in many people with diabetes, glucagon levels stay higher than needed. high glucagon levels cause the liver to produce unneeded glucose, which contributes to high blood glucose levels. metformin, the most commonly used drug to treat type 2 diabetes, reduces glucose production by the liver. the roles of insulin and glucagon in normal blood glucose regulation a healthy persons body keeps blood glucose levels in a normal range through several complex mechanisms. insulin and glucagon, two hormones made in the pancreas, help regulate blood glucose levels: - insulin, made by beta cells, lowers elevated blood glucose levels. - glucagon, made by alpha cells, raises low blood glucose levels. - insulin helps muscle, fat, and liver cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream, lowering blood glucose levels. - insulin stimulates the liver and muscle tissue to store excess glucose. the stored form of glucose is called glycogen. - insulin also lowers blood glucose levels by reducing glucose production in the liver. - glucagon signals the liver and muscle tissue to break down glycogen into glucose, which enters the bloodstream and raises blood glucose levels. - if the body needs more glucose, glucagon stimulates the liver to make glucose from amino acids. metabolic syndrome metabolic syndrome, also called insulin resistance syndrome, refers to a group of conditions common in people with insulin resistance, including - higher than normal blood glucose levels - increased waist size due to excess abdominal fat - high blood pressure - abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood cell signaling and regulation cells communicate through a complex network of molecular signaling pathways. for example, on cell surfaces, insulin receptor molecules capture, or bind, insulin molecules circulating in the bloodstream. this interaction between insulin and its receptor prompts the biochemical signals that enable the cells to absorb glucose from the blood and use it for energy. problems in cell signaling systems can set off a chain reaction that leads to diabetes or other diseases. many studies have focused on how insulin signals cells to communicate and regulate action. researchers have identified proteins and pathways that transmit the insulin signal and have mapped interactions between insulin and body tissues, including the way insulin helps the liver control blood glucose levels. researchers have also found that key signals also come from fat cells, which produce substances that cause inflammation and insulin resistance. this work holds the key to combating insulin resistance and diabetes. as scientists learn more about cell signaling systems involved in glucose regulation, they will have more opportunities to develop effective treatments. beta cell dysfunction scientists think beta cell dysfunction is a key contributor to type 2 diabetes. beta cell impairment can cause inadequate or abnormal patterns of insulin release. also, beta cells may be damaged by high blood glucose itself, a condition called glucose toxicity. scientists have not determined the causes of beta cell dysfunction in most cases. single gene defects lead to specific forms of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody). the genes involved regulate insulin production in the beta cells. although these forms of diabetes are rare, they provide clues as to how beta cell function may be affected by key regulatory factors. other gene variants are involved in determining the number and function of beta cells. but these variants account for only a small percentage of type 2 diabetes cases. malnutrition early in life is also being investigated as a cause of beta cell dysfunction. the metabolic environment of the developing fetus may also create a predisposition for diabetes later in life. risk factors for type 2 diabetes people who develop type 2 diabetes are more likely to have the following characteristics: - age 45 or older - overweight or obese - physically inactive - parent or sibling with diabetes - family background that is african american, alaska native, american indian, asian american, hispanic/latino, or pacific islander american - history of giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds - history of gestational diabetes - high blood pressure140/90 or aboveor being treated for high blood pressure - high-density lipoprotein (hdl), or good, cholesterol below 35 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl), or a triglyceride level above 250 mg/dl - polycystic ovary syndrome, also called pcos - prediabetesan a1c level of 5.7 to 6.4 percent; a fasting plasma glucose test result of 100125 mg/dl, called impaired fasting glucose; or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test result of 140199, called impaired glucose tolerance - acanthosis nigricans, a condition associated with insulin resistance, characterized by a dark, velvety rash around the neck or armpits - history of cvd the american diabetes association (ada) recommends that testing to detect prediabetes and type 2 diabetes be considered in adults who are overweight or obese and have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. in adults without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45.",niddk,causes of diabetes
what causes causes of diabetes ?,"insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction hormones produced by the placenta and other pregnancy-related factors contribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. insulin resistance increases the amount of insulin needed to control blood glucose levels. if the pancreas cant produce enough insulin due to beta cell dysfunction, gestational diabetes occurs. as with type 2 diabetes, excess weight is linked to gestational diabetes. overweight or obese women are at particularly high risk for gestational diabetes because they start pregnancy with a higher need for insulin due to insulin resistance. excessive weight gain during pregnancy may also increase risk. family history having a family history of diabetes is also a risk factor for gestational diabetes, suggesting that genes play a role in its development. genetics may also explain why the disorder occurs more frequently in african americans, american indians, and hispanics/latinos. many gene variants or combinations of variants may increase a womans risk for developing gestational diabetes. studies have found several gene variants associated with gestational diabetes, but these variants account for only a small fraction of women with gestational diabetes. future risk of type 2 diabetes because a womans hormones usually return to normal levels soon after giving birth, gestational diabetes disappears in most women after delivery. however, women who have gestational diabetes are more likely to develop gestational diabetes with future pregnancies and develop type 2 diabetes.3 women with gestational diabetes should be tested for persistent diabetes 6 to 12 weeks after delivery and at least every 3 years thereafter. also, exposure to high glucose levels during gestation increases a childs risk for becoming overweight or obese and for developing type 2 diabetes later on. the result may be a cycle of diabetes affecting multiple generations in a family. for both mother and child, maintaining a healthy body weight and being physically active may help prevent type 2 diabetes.",niddk,causes of diabetes
what causes causes of diabetes ?,"other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes. genetic mutations affecting beta cells, insulin, and insulin action some relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. these mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin. the most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (ndm) and mody. ndm occurs in the first 6 months of life. mody is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life. more information about ndm and mody is provided in the niddk health topic, monogenic forms of diabetes. other rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors. other genetic diseases diabetes occurs in people with down syndrome, klinefelter syndrome, and turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population. scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes. the genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes. cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus, which blocks the pancreas. the risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis. hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. if the disorder is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs. damage to or removal of the pancreas pancreatitis, cancer, and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production, thus causing diabetes. if the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells. endocrine diseases endocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones. cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance. cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas, can also cause diabetes. the tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. hyperthyroidism, a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, can also cause elevated blood glucose levels. autoimmune disorders rare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. this kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells, similar to type 1 diabetes. medications and chemical toxins some medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. pentamidine, a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia, can increase the risk of pancreatitis, beta cell damage, and diabetes. also, glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis. many chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals, but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. for example, dioxina contaminant of the herbicide agent orange, used during the vietnam warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. in 2000, based on a report from the institute of medicine, the u.s. department of veterans affairs (va) added diabetes to the list of conditions for which vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. also, a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes. arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes. lipodystrophy lipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body. the condition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",niddk,causes of diabetes

what is (are) renal tubular acidosis ?,"renal tubular acidosis (rta) is a disease that occurs when the kidneys fail to excrete acids into the urine, which causes a person's blood to remain too acidic. without proper treatment, chronic acidity of the blood leads to growth retardation, kidney stones, bone disease, chronic kidney disease, and possibly total kidney failure. the body's cells use chemical reactions to carry out tasks such as turning food into energy and repairing tissue. these chemical reactions generate acids. some acid in the blood is normal, but too much acidacidosiscan disturb many bodily functions. healthy kidneys help maintain acid-base balance by excreting acids into the urine and returning bicarbonatean alkaline, or base, substanceto the blood. this ""reclaimed"" bicarbonate neutralizes much of the acid that is created when food is broken down in the body. the movement of substances like bicarbonate between the blood and structures in the kidneys is called transport. one researcher has theorized that charles dickens may have been describing a child with rta in the character of tiny tim from a christmas carol. tiny tim's small stature, malformed limbs, and periods of weakness are all possible consequences of the chemical imbalance caused by rta.1 in the story, tiny tim recovers when he receives medical treatment, which would likely have included sodium bicarbonate and sodium citrate, alkaline agents to neutralize acidic blood. the good news is that medical treatment can indeed reverse the effects of rta.",niddk,renal tubular acidosis

what is (are) renal tubular acidosis ?,"type 1: classical distal rta type 1 is also called classical distal rta. ""distal,"" which means distant, refers to the point in the urine-forming tube of the kidney where the defect occursrelatively distant from the point where fluid from the blood enters the tiny tube, or tubule, that collects fluid and wastes to form urine. this disorder may be inherited as a primary disorder or may be one symptom of a disease that affects many parts of the body. researchers have discovered abnormal genes responsible for the inherited forms of the disease. more often, however, classical distal rta occurs as a result of systemic diseasesdiseases that affect many organ systemslike the autoimmune disorders sjgren's syndrome and lupus, which also attack the distal tubule. other diseases and conditions associated with classical distal rta include sickle cell anemia, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, a hereditary form of deafness, analgesic nephropathy, rejection of a transplanted kidney, renal medullary cystic disease, obstructive uropathy, and chronic urinary tract infections. many of these conditions cause abnormal calcium deposits to build up in the kidney and impair distal tubule function. a major consequence of classical distal rta is a low blood potassium level. the level drops if the kidneys excrete too much potassium into urine instead of returning it to the blood supply. because potassium helps regulate nerve and muscle health and heart rate, low levels can cause extreme weakness, irregular heartbeat, paralysis, and even death. untreated classical distal rta causes growth retardation in children and progressive kidney and bone disease in adults. restoring normal growth and preventing kidney stones are the major goals of therapy. if acidosis is corrected with sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate, then low blood-potassium, salt depletion, and calcium leakage into urine will be corrected. this alkali therapy also helps decrease the development of kidney stones and stabilizes kidney function so kidney failure does not progress. infants may need potassium supplements, but older children and adults rarely do because alkali therapy prevents the kidney from excreting potassium into the urine. type 2: proximal rta type 2 is also called proximal rta. the word ""proximal,"" which means near, indicates that the defect is closer to the point where fluid and wastes from the blood enter the tubule. this form of rta occurs most frequently in children as part of a disorder called fanconi's syndrome. the features of fanconi's syndrome include the abnormal excretion of glucose, amino acids, citrate, and phosphate into the urine, as well as vitamin d deficiency and low blood-potassium. proximal rta can also result from inherited disorders that disrupt the body's normal breakdown and use of nutrients. examples include the rare disease cystinosis, in which cystine crystals are deposited in bones and other tissues; hereditary fructose intolerance; and wilson disease. proximal rta also occurs in patients treated with ifosfamide, a drug used in chemotherapy. a few older drugssuch as acetazolamide or outdated tetracyclinecan also cause proximal rta. in adults, proximal rta may complicate diseases like multiple myeloma, or it may occur in people who experience chronic rejection of a transplanted kidney. when possible, identifying and correcting the underlying causes are important steps in treating the acquired forms of proximal rta. the diagnosis is based on the chemical analysis of blood and urine samples. children with this disorder would likely receive large doses of an oral alkali, such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate, to treat acidosis and prevent bone disorders, kidney stones, and growth failure. correcting acidosis and low potassium levels restores normal growth patterns, allowing bone to mature while preventing further renal disease. vitamin d supplements may also be needed to help prevent bone problems. type 3 type 3 is rarely used as a classification because it is now thought to be a combination of type 1 and type 2. type 4: hyperkalemic rta type 4 is also called hyperkalemic rta and is caused by a generalized transport abnormality of the distal tubule. the transport of electrolytes such as sodium, chloride, and potassium that normally occurs in the distal tubule is impaired. this form is distinguished from classical distal rta and proximal rta because it results in high levels of potassium in the blood instead of low levels. either low potassiumhypokalemiaor high potassiumhyperkalemiacan be a problem because potassium is important in regulating heart rate. type 4 rta occurs when blood levels of the hormone aldosterone are low or when the kidneys do not respond to it. aldosterone directs the kidneys to regulate the levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the blood. type 4 rta also occurs when the tubule transport of electrolytes such as sodium, chloride, and potassium is impaired due to an inherited disorder or the use of certain drugs. drugs that may cause type 4 rta include - diuretics used to treat congestive heart failure such as spironolactone or eplerenone - blood pressure drugs called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (arbs) - the antibiotic trimethoprim - the antibiotic pentamidine, which is used to treat pneumonia - an agent called heparin that keeps blood from clotting - a class of painkillers called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) - some immunosuppressive drugs used to prevent rejection type 4 rta may also result from diseases that alter kidney structure and function such as diabetic nephropathy, hiv/aids, addison's disease, sickle cell disease, urinary tract obstruction, lupus, amyloidosis, removal or destruction of both adrenal glands, and kidney transplant rejection. for people who produce aldosterone but cannot use it, researchers have identified the genetic basis for their body's resistance to the hormone. to treat type 4 rta successfully, patients may require alkaline agents to correct acidosis and medication to lower the potassium in their blood. if treated early, most people with any type of rta will not develop permanent kidney failure. therefore, the goal is early recognition and adequate therapy, which will need to be maintained and monitored throughout the person's lifetime.",niddk,renal tubular acidosis

what is (are) causes of diabetes ?,"diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. people with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia. diabetes is a disorder of metabolismthe way the body uses digested food for energy. the digestive tract breaks down carbohydratessugars and starches found in many foodsinto glucose, a form of sugar that enters the bloodstream. with the help of the hormone insulin, cells throughout the body absorb glucose and use it for energy. diabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both. insulin is made in the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach. the pancreas contains clusters of cells called islets. beta cells within the islets make insulin and release it into the blood. if beta cells dont produce enough insulin, or the body doesnt respond to the insulin that is present, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels or a1c levelswhich reflect average blood glucose levelsare higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. in diabetes, the bodys cells are starved of energy despite high blood glucose levels. over time, high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels, leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, dental disease, and amputations. other complications of diabetes may include increased susceptibility to other diseases, loss of mobility with aging, depression, and pregnancy problems. no one is certain what starts the processes that cause diabetes, but scientists believe genes and environmental factors interact to cause diabetes in most cases. the two main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. a third type, gestational diabetes, develops only during pregnancy. other types of diabetes are caused by defects in specific genes, diseases of the pancreas, certain drugs or chemicals, infections, and other conditions. some people show signs of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",niddk,causes of diabetes
what causes causes of diabetes ?,"type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. in type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells. normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. but in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells. in type 1 diabetes, beta cell destruction may take place over several years, but symptoms of the disease usually develop over a short period of time. type 1 diabetes typically occurs in children and young adults, though it can appear at any age. in the past, type 1 diabetes was called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (lada) may be a slowly developing kind of type 1 diabetes. diagnosis usually occurs after age 30. in lada, as in type 1 diabetes, the bodys immune system destroys the beta cells. at the time of diagnosis, people with lada may still produce their own insulin, but eventually most will need insulin shots or an insulin pump to control blood glucose levels. genetic susceptibility heredity plays an important part in determining who is likely to develop type 1 diabetes. genes are passed down from biological parent to child. genes carry instructions for making proteins that are needed for the bodys cells to function. many genes, as well as interactions among genes, are thought to influence susceptibility to and protection from type 1 diabetes. the key genes may vary in different population groups. variations in genes that affect more than 1 percent of a population group are called gene variants. certain gene variants that carry instructions for making proteins called human leukocyte antigens (hlas) on white blood cells are linked to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. the proteins produced by hla genes help determine whether the immune system recognizes a cell as part of the body or as foreign material. some combinations of hla gene variants predict that a person will be at higher risk for type 1 diabetes, while other combinations are protective or have no effect on risk. while hla genes are the major risk genes for type 1 diabetes, many additional risk genes or gene regions have been found. not only can these genes help identify people at risk for type 1 diabetes, but they also provide important clues to help scientists better understand how the disease develops and identify potential targets for therapy and prevention. genetic testing can show what types of hla genes a person carries and can reveal other genes linked to diabetes. however, most genetic testing is done in a research setting and is not yet available to individuals. scientists are studying how the results of genetic testing can be used to improve type 1 diabetes prevention or treatment. autoimmune destruction of beta cells in type 1 diabetes, white blood cells called t cells attack and destroy beta cells. the process begins well before diabetes symptoms appear and continues after diagnosis. often, type 1 diabetes is not diagnosed until most beta cells have already been destroyed. at this point, a person needs daily insulin treatment to survive. finding ways to modify or stop this autoimmune process and preserve beta cell function is a major focus of current scientific research. recent research suggests insulin itself may be a key trigger of the immune attack on beta cells. the immune systems of people who are susceptible to developing type 1 diabetes respond to insulin as if it were a foreign substance, or antigen. to combat antigens, the body makes proteins called antibodies. antibodies to insulin and other proteins produced by beta cells are found in people with type 1 diabetes. researchers test for these antibodies to help identify people at increased risk of developing the disease. testing the types and levels of antibodies in the blood can help determine whether a person has type 1 diabetes, lada, or another type of diabetes. environmental factors environmental factors, such as foods, viruses, and toxins, may play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes, but the exact nature of their role has not been determined. some theories suggest that environmental factors trigger the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in people with a genetic susceptibility to diabetes. other theories suggest that environmental factors play an ongoing role in diabetes, even after diagnosis. viruses and infections. a virus cannot cause diabetes on its own, but people are sometimes diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during or after a viral infection, suggesting a link between the two. also, the onset of type 1 diabetes occurs more frequently during the winter when viral infections are more common. viruses possibly associated with type 1 diabetes include coxsackievirus b, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, rubella, and mumps. scientists have described several ways these viruses may damage or destroy beta cells or possibly trigger an autoimmune response in susceptible people. for example, anti-islet antibodies have been found in patients with congenital rubella syndrome, and cytomegalovirus has been associated with significant beta cell damage and acute pancreatitisinflammation of the pancreas. scientists are trying to identify a virus that can cause type 1 diabetes so that a vaccine might be developed to prevent the disease. infant feeding practices. some studies have suggested that dietary factors may raise or lower the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. for example, breastfed infants and infants receiving vitamin d supplements may have a reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes, while early exposure to cows milk and cereal proteins may increase risk. more research is needed to clarify how infant nutrition affects the risk for type 1 diabetes. read more in the centers for disease control and preventions (cdcs) publication national diabetes statistics report, 2014 at www.cdc.gov for information about research studies related

what causes causes of diabetes ?,"type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin. symptoms of type 2 diabetes may develop gradually and can be subtle; some people with type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed for years. type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people who are also overweight or obese. the disease, once rare in youth, is becoming more common in overweight and obese children and adolescents. scientists think genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are the most likely triggers of type 2 diabetes. genetic susceptibility genes play a significant part in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. having certain genes or combinations of genes may increase or decrease a persons risk for developing the disease. the role of genes is suggested by the high rate of type 2 diabetes in families and identical twins and wide variations in diabetes prevalence by ethnicity. type 2 diabetes occurs more frequently in african americans, alaska natives, american indians, hispanics/latinos, and some asian americans, native hawaiians, and pacific islander americans than it does in non-hispanic whites. recent studies have combined genetic data from large numbers of people, accelerating the pace of gene discovery. though scientists have now identified many gene variants that increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, the majority have yet to be discovered. the known genes appear to affect insulin production rather than insulin resistance. researchers are working to identify additional gene variants and to learn how they interact with one another and with environmental factors to cause diabetes. studies have shown that variants of the tcf7l2 gene increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. for people who inherit two copies of the variants, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is about 80 percent higher than for those who do not carry the gene variant.1 however, even in those with the variant, diet and physical activity leading to weight loss help delay diabetes, according to the diabetes prevention program (dpp), a major clinical trial involving people at high risk. genes can also increase the risk of diabetes by increasing a persons tendency to become overweight or obese. one theory, known as the thrifty gene hypothesis, suggests certain genes increase the efficiency of metabolism to extract energy from food and store the energy for later use. this survival trait was advantageous for populations whose food supplies were scarce or unpredictable and could help keep people alive during famine. in modern times, however, when high-calorie foods are plentiful, such a trait can promote obesity and type 2 diabetes. obesity and physical inactivity physical inactivity and obesity are strongly associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. people who are genetically susceptible to type 2 diabetes are more vulnerable when these risk factors are present. an imbalance between caloric intake and physical activity can lead to obesity, which causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. central obesity, in which a person has excess abdominal fat, is a major risk factor not only for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes but also for heart and blood vessel disease, also called cardiovascular disease (cvd). this excess belly fat produces hormones and other substances that can cause harmful, chronic effects in the body such as damage to blood vessels. the dpp and other studies show that millions of people can lower their risk for type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle changes and losing weight. the dpp proved that people with prediabetesat high risk of developing type 2 diabetescould sharply lower their risk by losing weight through regular physical activity and a diet low in fat and calories. in 2009, a follow-up study of dpp participantsthe diabetes prevention program outcomes study (dppos)showed that the benefits of weight loss lasted for at least 10 years after the original study began.2 read more about the dpp, funded under national institutes of health (nih) clinical trial number nct00004992, and the dppos, funded under nih clinical trial number nct00038727 in diabetes prevention program. insulin resistance insulin resistance is a common condition in people who are overweight or obese, have excess abdominal fat, and are not physically active. muscle, fat, and liver cells stop responding properly to insulin, forcing the pancreas to compensate by producing extra insulin. as long as beta cells are able to produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels stay in the normal range. but when insulin production falters because of beta cell dysfunction, glucose levels rise, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. abnormal glucose production by the liver in some people with diabetes, an abnormal increase in glucose production by the liver also contributes to high blood glucose levels. normally, the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon when blood glucose and insulin levels are low. glucagon stimulates the liver to produce glucose and release it into the bloodstream. but when blood glucose and insulin levels are high after a meal, glucagon levels drop, and the liver stores excess glucose for later, when it is needed. for reasons not completely understood, in many people with diabetes, glucagon levels stay higher than needed. high glucagon levels cause the liver to produce unneeded glucose, which contributes to high blood glucose levels. metformin, the most commonly used drug to treat type 2 diabetes, reduces glucose production by the liver. the roles of insulin and glucagon in normal blood glucose regulation a healthy persons body keeps blood glucose levels in a normal range through several complex mechanisms. insulin and glucagon, two hormones made in the pancreas, help regulate blood glucose levels: - insulin, made by beta cells, lowers elevated blood glucose levels. - glucagon, made by alpha cells, raises low blood glucose levels. - insulin helps muscle, fat, and liver cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream, lowering blood glucose levels. - insulin stimulates the liver and muscle tissue to store excess glucose. the stored form of glucose is called glycogen. - insulin also lowers blood glucose levels by reducing glucose production in the liver. - glucagon signals the liver and muscle tissue to break down glycogen into glucose, which enters the bloodstream and raises blood glucose levels. - if the body needs more glucose, glucagon stimulates the liver to make glucose from amino acids. metabolic syndrome metabolic syndrome, also called insulin resistance syndrome, refers to a group of conditions common in people with insulin resistance, including - higher than normal blood glucose levels - increased waist size due to excess abdominal fat - high blood pressure - abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood cell signaling and regulation cells communicate through a complex network of molecular signaling pathways. for example, on cell surfaces, insulin receptor molecules capture, or bind, insulin molecules circulating in the bloodstream. this interaction between insulin and its receptor prompts the biochemical signals that enable the cells to absorb glucose from the blood and use it for energy. problems in cell signaling systems can set off a chain reaction that leads to diabetes or other diseases. many studies have focused on how insulin signals cells to communicate and regulate action. researchers have identified proteins and pathways that transmit the insulin signal and have mapped interactions between insulin and body tissues, including the way insulin helps the liver control blood glucose levels. researchers have also found that key signals also come from fat cells, which produce substances that cause inflammation and insulin resistance. this work holds the key to combating insulin resistance and diabetes. as scientists learn more about cell signaling systems involved in glucose regulation, they will have more opportunities to develop effective treatments. beta cell dysfunction scientists think beta cell dysfunction is a key contributor to type 2 diabetes. beta cell impairment can cause inadequate or abnormal patterns of insulin release. also, beta cells may be damaged by high blood glucose itself, a condition called glucose toxicity. scientists have not determined the causes of beta cell dysfunction in most cases. single gene defects lead to specific forms of diabetes called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody). the genes involved regulate insulin production in the beta cells. although these forms of diabetes are rare, they provide clues as to how beta cell function may be affected by key regulatory factors. other gene variants are involved in determining the number and function of beta cells. but these variants account for only a small percentage of type 2 diabetes cases. malnutrition early in life is also being investigated as a cause of beta cell dysfunction. the metabolic environment of the developing fetus may also create a predisposition for diabetes later in life. risk factors for type 2 diabetes people who develop type 2 diabetes are more likely to have the following characteristics: - age 45 or older - overweight or obese - physically inactive - parent or sibling with diabetes - family background that is african american, alaska native, american indian, asian american, hispanic/latino, or pacific islander american - history of giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds - history of gestational diabetes - high blood pressure140/90 or aboveor being treated for high blood pressure - high-density lipoprotein (hdl), or good, cholesterol below 35 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl), or a triglyceride level above 250 mg/dl - polycystic ovary syndrome, also called pcos - prediabetesan a1c level of 5.7 to 6.4 percent; a fasting plasma glucose test result of 100125 mg/dl, called impaired fasting glucose; or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test result of 140199, called impaired glucose tolerance - acanthosis nigricans, a condition associated with insulin resistance, characterized by a dark, velvety rash around the neck or armpits - history of cvd the american diabetes association (ada) recommends that testing to detect prediabetes and type 2 diabetes be considered in adults who are overweight or obese and have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. in adults without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45.",niddk,causes of diabetes
what causes causes of diabetes ?,"insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction hormones produced by the placenta and other pregnancy-related factors contribute to insulin resistance, which occurs in all women during late pregnancy. insulin resistance increases the amount of insulin needed to control blood glucose levels. if the pancreas cant produce enough insulin due to beta cell dysfunction, gestational diabetes occurs. as with type 2 diabetes, excess weight is linked to gestational diabetes. overweight or obese women are at particularly high risk for gestational diabetes because they start pregnancy with a higher need for insulin due to insulin resistance. excessive weight gain during pregnancy may also increase risk. family history having a family history of diabetes is also a risk factor for gestational diabetes, suggesting that genes play a role in its development. genetics may also explain why the disorder occurs more frequently in african americans, american indians, and hispanics/latinos. many gene variants or combinations of variants may increase a womans risk for developing gestational diabetes. studies have found several gene variants associated with gestational diabetes, but these variants account for only a small fraction of women with gestational diabetes. future risk of type 2 diabetes because a womans hormones usually return to normal levels soon after giving birth, gestational diabetes disappears in most women after delivery. however, women who have gestational diabetes are more likely to develop gestational diabetes with future pregnancies and develop type 2 diabetes.3 women with gestational diabetes should be tested for persistent diabetes 6 to 12 weeks after delivery and at least every 3 years thereafter. also, exposure to high glucose levels during gestation increases a childs risk for becoming overweight or obese and for developing type 2 diabetes later on. the result may be a cycle of diabetes affecting multiple generations in a family. for both mother and child, maintaining a healthy body weight and being physically active may help prevent type 2 diabetes.",niddk,causes of diabetes
what causes causes of diabetes ?,"other types of diabetes have a variety of possible causes. genetic mutations affecting beta cells, insulin, and insulin action some relatively uncommon forms of diabetes known as monogenic diabetes are caused by mutations, or changes, in a single gene. these mutations are usually inherited, but sometimes the gene mutation occurs spontaneously. most of these gene mutations cause diabetes by reducing beta cells ability to produce insulin. the most common types of monogenic diabetes are neonatal diabetes mellitus (ndm) and mody. ndm occurs in the first 6 months of life. mody is usually found during adolescence or early adulthood but sometimes is not diagnosed until later in life. more information about ndm and mody is provided in the niddk health topic, monogenic forms of diabetes. other rare genetic mutations can cause diabetes by damaging the quality of insulin the body produces or by causing abnormalities in insulin receptors. other genetic diseases diabetes occurs in people with down syndrome, klinefelter syndrome, and turner syndrome at higher rates than the general population. scientists are investigating whether genes that may predispose people to genetic syndromes also predispose them to diabetes. the genetic disorders cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis are linked to diabetes. cystic fibrosis produces abnormally thick mucus, which blocks the pancreas. the risk of diabetes increases with age in people with cystic fibrosis. hemochromatosis causes the body to store too much iron. if the disorder is not treated, iron can build up in and damage the pancreas and other organs. damage to or removal of the pancreas pancreatitis, cancer, and trauma can all harm the pancreatic beta cells or impair insulin production, thus causing diabetes. if the damaged pancreas is removed, diabetes will occur due to the loss of the beta cells. endocrine diseases endocrine diseases affect organs that produce hormones. cushings syndrome and acromegaly are examples of hormonal disorders that can cause prediabetes and diabetes by inducing insulin resistance. cushings syndrome is marked by excessive production of cortisolsometimes called the stress hormone. acromegaly occurs when the body produces too much growth hormone. glucagonoma, a rare tumor of the pancreas, can also cause diabetes. the tumor causes the body to produce too much glucagon. hyperthyroidism, a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, can also cause elevated blood glucose levels. autoimmune disorders rare disorders characterized by antibodies that disrupt insulin action can lead to diabetes. this kind of diabetes is often associated with other autoimmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus. another rare autoimmune disorder called stiff-man syndrome is associated with antibodies that attack the beta cells, similar to type 1 diabetes. medications and chemical toxins some medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action. pentamidine, a drug prescribed to treat a type of pneumonia, can increase the risk of pancreatitis, beta cell damage, and diabetes. also, glucocorticoidssteroid hormones that are chemically similar to naturally produced cortisolmay impair insulin action. glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammatory illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, and ulcerative colitis. many chemical toxins can damage or destroy beta cells in animals, but only a few have been linked to diabetes in humans. for example, dioxina contaminant of the herbicide agent orange, used during the vietnam warmay be linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. in 2000, based on a report from the institute of medicine, the u.s. department of veterans affairs (va) added diabetes to the list of conditions for which vietnam veterans are eligible for disability compensation. also, a chemical in a rat poison no longer in use has been shown to cause diabetes if ingested. some studies suggest a high intake of nitrogen-containing chemicals such as nitrates and nitrites might increase the risk of diabetes. arsenic has also been studied for possible links to diabetes. lipodystrophy lipodystrophy is a condition in which fat tissue is lost or redistributed in the body. the condition is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",niddk,causes of diabetes

what to do for causes of diabetes ?,"- diabetes is a complex group of diseases with a variety of causes. scientists believe genes and environmental factors interact to cause diabetes in most cases. - people with diabetes have high blood glucose, also called high blood sugar or hyperglycemia. diabetes develops when the body doesnt make enough insulin or is not able to use insulin effectively, or both. - insulin is a hormone made by beta cells in the pancreas. insulin helps cells throughout the body absorb and use glucose for energy. if the body does not produce enough insulin or cannot use insulin effectively, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body, and the body is starved of energy. - prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels or a1c levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. people with prediabetes can substantially reduce their risk of developing diabetes by losing weight and increasing physical activity. - the two main types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. gestational diabetes is a third form of diabetes that develops only during pregnancy. - type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction of insulin-producing beta cells. in type 1 diabetesan autoimmune diseasethe bodys immune system attacks and destroys the beta cells. - type 2 diabetesthe most common form of diabetesis caused by a combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in which the bodys muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin effectively. type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use insulin. - scientists believe gestational diabetes is caused by the hormonal changes and metabolic demands of pregnancy together with genetic and environmental factors. risk factors for gestational diabetes include being overweight and having a family history of diabetes. - monogenic forms of diabetes are relatively uncommon and are caused by mutations in single genes that limit insulin production, quality, or action in the body. - other types of diabetes are caused by diseases and injuries that damage the pancreas; certain chemical toxins and medications; infections; and other conditions.",niddk,causes of diabetes
