# BetterGPT2-MedQuA

## Overview
This repository demonstrates fine-tuning GPT-2 on the MedQA dataset using Hugging Face Transformersâ€”all executed via Google Colab. The project starts with a basic fine-tuning pipeline and then integrates advanced training and inference enhancements that yield significantly improved performance in generating accurate medical Q&A responses.

## Original Approach
The initial pipeline included:
- **Data Acquisition:** Downloading the MedQA dataset from Kaggle.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Converting text to lowercase, removing duplicates and missing values, and formatting Q&A pairs using special tokens (`<question>`, `<answer>`, `<end>`).
- **Model Training:** Fine-tuning the base GPT-2 model using standard training parameters.
- **Inference:** Generating responses through a straightforward decoding function.

## Enhancements
To achieve superior results, we incorporated the following advanced techniques:
- **Model Upgrade:** Transition from `gpt2` to `gpt2-medium` for greater capacity.
- **Advanced Training Strategies:**
  - **Gradient Accumulation:** Simulate larger batch sizes without overwhelming GPU memory.
  - **Early Stopping:** Monitor evaluation loss to halt training when performance plateaus.
  - **Enhanced Logging:** More frequent logging for detailed monitoring of the training process.
- **Improved Inference Methods:**
  - **Top-K & Nucleus Sampling:** Enable more diverse, coherent, and contextually relevant outputs.
- **Rigorous Evaluation:** Compute perplexity from evaluation loss as a quantitative measure of model performance.

## Impact on Results
These enhancements have led to:
- **Faster Convergence:** More stable and efficient training.
- **Better Generalization:** Lower perplexity values, indicating improved performance on unseen data.
- **Enhanced Response Quality:** Generation of more accurate and context-aware answers for medical queries.
