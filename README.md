# GPT2-MedQA-Enhanced

## Overview
This repository fine-tunes GPT-2 on the MedQA dataset using Hugging Face Transformers. It starts with a basic fine-tuning pipeline and then incorporates advanced training and inference enhancements, leading to significantly improved performance in generating accurate medical Q&A responses.

## Original Approach
The original pipeline involved:
- **Data Gathering:** Downloading the MedQA dataset from Kaggle.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Lowercasing text, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting Q&A pairs using custom tokens (`<question>`, `<answer>`, `<end>`).
- **Model Training:** Fine-tuning the base GPT-2 model with standard training parameters.
- **Inference:** A simple response generation function to produce answers from medical queries.

## Enhancements
To boost performance, the following advanced techniques were introduced:
- **Model Upgrade:** Switched to `gpt2-medium` for higher capacity.
- **Advanced Training Techniques:**
  - **Gradient Accumulation:** Simulates larger batch sizes without exceeding GPU memory.
  - **Early Stopping:** Monitors evaluation loss to halt training when improvements stagnate.
  - **Enhanced Logging:** More frequent logging for detailed training insights.
- **Improved Inference:**
  - **Top-K and Nucleus Sampling:** Enables more diverse and coherent output generation.
- **Rigorous Evaluation:** Perplexity is computed from evaluation loss to quantitatively assess model performance.

## Impact on Results
These enhancements have led to:
- **Faster Convergence:** Improved training stability and speed.
- **Better Generalization:** Lower perplexity and more accurate predictions on unseen medical Q&A data.
- **Enhanced Response Quality:** More contextually relevant and diverse responses for medical queries.
